of unilateral hearing loss with incomplete recovery in these patients have been reported and attributed to either embolism or perfusion failure in 1971 arenberg et al for the first time reported on a 57 year old female who had a unilateral sudden hearing loss with some improvement in the early post operative period in 1975 wright and saunders reported on a 59 year old male who had a sudden loss of hearing which did not improve in 1981 plasse et al reported seven cases all with early post operative hearing loss four of whom improved some degree but none recovered completely shapiro et al 1981 reported two cases of bilateral loss of hearing with no indication of improvement in hearing brownson et al 1971 in a prospective study of 50 patients found no significant changes in hearing following

The clinical target volume included the tumour bed with a 1.5-2 cm margin, perilesional oedema and was expanded to encompass the ipsilateral PVZ (5 mm lateral expansion adjacent to the ventricles, including the SVZ, which was a 5 mm expansion lateral to lateral ventricle). The ipsilateral PVZ was planned to receive a dose of ≥50 Gy.\nResults: 89 patients were recruited of which 74 patients were available for the analysis. Median age was 48 years. Mean doses to ipsilateral PVZ and SVZ were 56.2 and 55.1Gy, respectively. Median overall survival in the entire group was 13 months. There was no significant correlation between survival and doses to ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral PVZ and SVZ. Median survival was 16, 12 and 6 months for Eastern Cooperative -Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 1, 2 and 3, respectively (\nConclusion: Planned irradiation of potential stem cell niches in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere did not result in improved survival as suggested by retrospective studies.

sucrose phosphate synthase in bundle sheath cells prepared from c4 species sucrose synthesis was followed by measuring the incorporation of 14c fructose 6 phosphate into sucrose in bundle sheath cells also provided with uridine 5 diphosphoglucose udpglc studies with panicum miliaceum l cells showed that activation was largely due to an increase in the affinity for udpglc and was therefore only evident at limiting udpglc concentrations the apparent km udpglc for sucrose synthesis by cells pretreated and assayed with atp was about 0 7 mm compared with 7 8 mm for control cells without atp the thio derivative of atp had a similar effect to atp the effect was also evident when atp was rapidly removed from cells prior to assay sucrose phosphate synthase activity in extracts from cells pretreated with or without atp showed similar differences in km udpglc these observations support the view that atp is inducing a covalent modification of the enzyme however several protein kinase inhibitors did not prevent activation changes of more than threefold were observed for the km udpglc with sucrose phosphate synthase extracted from bundle sheath cells rapidly isolated from attached leaves that were subjected to dark light treatments the possible relationship between these changes and those induced by atp with isolated cells is discussed this is a preview of subscription content

aggregatum group alien chromosome addition lines were used to determine the chromosomal locations of genes related to bulb formation in shallot the morphological characteristics of 17 multiple alien addition lines were investigated by measuring maximum bulb diameter calculating the bulbing ratio and counting the number of shoots of the 17 multiple addition lines four u138 u154 u4 and u87 in which chromosome 2a was deleted and which also contained five or more additional chromosomes from shallot showed significantly higher values of maximum bulb diameter and bulbing ratio than multiple addition lines carrying 2a moreover the number of shoots in these four plants was fewer than in plants with multiple addition lines carrying 2a and in the allotriploid between a fistulosum and shallot a sucrose transporter gene of shallot was allocated to chromosome 5a through sequence characterised amplified region analysis using two sets of the monosomic addition lines these results indicate that a gene or genes inhibiting bulb formation and stimulating side shoot formation in shallot may be located on chromosome 2a and that the sucrose transporter gene is located on chromosome 5a of shallot

escherichia coli klebsiella sp nigeria introductiongo to section topabstractintroductionmethodologyresultsdiscussionconclusionreferencesantibiotic resistance ar is a global problem especially in the developing countries this condition increasingly compromises the outcome of various infections that were until recently treatable and remain the common infections in africa 1 ar also threatens public health in both developed and developing countries 2 the development of resistance by bacteria to different antibiotics has resulted in the difficult treatment of infectious diseases the infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria most especially multi resistance bacteria can lead to serious health problems such as long hospital stay treatment failure and death 3 the major factors causing the development of bacterial resistance include the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents in human and animal medicine agriculture and aquatic farming different mechanisms or their combination are used by bacteria in developing resistance to antibiotics however a particular mechanism may be dominant and can be identifiable 4 the presence of plasmids that contain one or more resistance genes with each encoding a single ar phenotype often causes the development of multiple ar mar in bacteria 5 these ar genes can transfer to other bacteria of the same or different species mar index is an effective valid and cost effective method that is used in source tracking of antibiotic resistant organisms 6 mar index is calculated as the ratio between the number of antibiotics that an isolate is resistant to and the total number of antibiotics the organism is exposed to a mar greater than 0 2 means that the high risk source of contamination is where antibiotics are frequently used 7escherichia coli is a gram negative motile facultative anaerobic bacterium which may or may not be encapsulated this species causes a wide range of infections in humans and is the most common causative agent in urinary tract infections this bacterium is a commonly isolated in medical microbiology laboratories 1 e coli is abundant in the human gastro intestinal tract and also serves as a reservoir or carrier of antibiotic resistant genes 8 e coli shows increasing resistance to different antibiotics especially to third generation cephalosporins 9klebsiella species are gram negative rod shaped nonmotile facultative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria klebsiella sp are an emerging threat to human health that causes both endemic and epidemic infections most hospital acquired infections caused by klebsiella sp cause a challenge in their treatment because of the development of mar strains the resistance of klebsiella strains to different generations of cephalosporins especially the third generation was first reported in 1981 since then these bacteria have become more resistant to antibiotics 10this study was carried out to determine the prevalence of multi antibiotic resistant e coli and klebsiella sp from clinical isolates methodologygo to section topabstractintroductionmethodologyresultsdiscussionconclusionreferencescollection of bacterial isolatespreidentified 98 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae were isolated from blood samples of both outpatients and inpatients from university college hospital ibadan and had been in storage for less than a month the present study examined 50 escherichia coli and 48 klebsiella sp samples nutrient agar slant bottles contained the isolates were stored the bacterial isolates were then transferred to microbiology laboratory of pure and applied biology ladoke akintola university of technology oyo state nigeria for further study antibiotic susceptibility testantibiotic susceptibility test was carried out by using disc diffusion kirby bauer method on mueller hinton agar plates bacterial suspension was prepared in 0 5 mcfarland turbidity standard for each isolate and was swabbed on already prepared nutrient agar plates the plates contained the impregnated antibiotics discs oxoid uk which were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the experiment used 14 antibiotics streptomycin 10 g amikacin 30 g gentamicin 10 g ciprofloxacin 5 g pefloxacin 5 g ofloxacin 5 g erythromycin 15 g nitrofurantoin 300 g oxacillin 50 g cloxacillin 10 g colistin sulfate 25 g cefepime 5 g ceftazidime 30 g and cefotaxime 75 g zones of

figures 1 and 2 respectively the test of all the strains against 14 different antibiotics applied the kirby bauer disc diffusion and underwent standardization and evaluation by the methods of the national committee for the clinical laboratory standards the percentile distribution was obtained for the prevalence of resistance of isolates to different classes of antibiotics including penicillin oxacillin cloxacillin aminoglycosides gentamycin streptomycin and amikacin fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin ofloxacin and pefloxacin macrolides erythromycin nitrofurantoin extended spectrum

topabstractintroductionmethodologyresultsdiscussionconclusionreferencesthe findings in this study reveal the high resistance rates of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella sp to commonly used antibiotics such as streptomycin 98 cloxacillin and oxacillin 96 and colistin 84 with relatively lower resistance rates to ciprofloxacin 66 these findings are similar to those from neighboring countries namely kenya12 and uganda 13 the findings can possibly result from the association of the isolates with ampc enzymes e coli showed the highest resistance toward streptomycin followed closely by cloxacillin oxacillin and erythromycin however the clinical isolates exhibited susceptibility to amikacin 36 followed closely by ofloxacin 26 cefotaxime 18 gentamycin and ciprofloxacin 22 the susceptibility patterns are similar to those observed by nahla et al 14 klebsiella presented the highest resistance toward cefotaxime 93 75 followed closely by cloxacillin oxacillin and colistin sulfate 91 67 a considerable resistance occurred with streptomycin similar to that in e coli and as shown in the work of kim et al 15 the present work revealed high susceptibility rates toward amikacin 33 37 which is similar to the result found in e coli followed by gentamycin and cefepime 22 92 this study also revealed that the highest multidrug resistance occurred in e coli with mar index of 1 00 and 17 out of 50 isolates 34 were resistant to all 14 antibiotics the mar index of klebsiella sp was 0 93 which differs from that of another work5 that reported an index of 0 4 contrary to the low resistance to aminoglycosides reported previously this work reported resistance of 87 5 68 75 and 58 38 in streptomycin gentamycin and amikacin respectively for klebsiella sp 7 isolates 14 6 were resistant to all 14 antibiotics whereas 12 isolates 25 were resistant to 13 out of 14 antibiotics tested these findings are similar to the results of osundiya et al 5 where 66 7 of the klebsiella isolates achieved a mar index greater than 0 2 the susceptibility of e coli to fluoroquinolones approximated 80 and this finding correlates with a review16 that reported an average of 80 susceptibility across different continents in khalit et al 17 klebsiella was resistant to ampicillins and third generation cephalosporins which corroborates the findings of this research conclusiongo to section topabstractintroductionmethodologyresultsdiscussionconclusionreferencesthese findings have implications for the choice of antibiotics for empirical management of infections and effective hospital infection control effective control must be in place to limit the spread of these pathogens further work should examine and identify the genes responsible for resistance and or virulence in these organisms to device preventive and curative alternative therapies in the form of vaccines and antimicrobials respectively referencesgo to section

mixtures and the relationship between content of various constituents and pharmacological action of the formulation is usually unclear such formulations are nevertheless standardized using a single marker constituent or a group of closely related constituents which provides no information about other abundant constituents present in the extract in this study principal component analysis of 600 mhz 1h nmr spectra of extracts of commercial formulations of st john s wort hypericum perforatum acquired in methanol d4 and dmso d6 was shown to be able to discriminate between various preparations according to their global composition including differentiation between various batches from the same supplier while no clustering into classes of tablets and capsules was observed this suggests that the plant extract variability rather than the manufacturing process accounts for the data clustering major variations in the content of flavonoids recently linked to the antidepressant activity of st john s wort extracts were detected use of two nmr solvents provided complementary data sets allowing assessment of various aspects of sample composition from separate pca models both integrated about 200 variables and full resolution nmr data about 30 000 variables have been used the latter approach applied for the first time in analysis of a herbal preparation provided via loading plots more

plasma cortisol response to surgery in depressed patients we studied 80 depressed patients and 40 control patients who had undergone orthopedic surgery and perioperatively measured plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropin levels postoperative confusion in the first 3 postoperative days occurred in 5 13 depressed patients given fentanyl during anesthesia 13 33 patients without fentanyl and 1 3 control patients plasma cortisol concentration 19 7 6 9 and 19 2 8 0 g dl 1 15 min after skin incision and 60 min after the end of surgery in depressed patients with fentanyl was significantly lower than that 24 2 7 2 and 23 5 8 1 g dl 1 of depressed patients without fentanyl plasma cortisol levels during and after surgery in depressed patients with postoperative confusion were higher than those of depressed patients without postoperative confusion we conclude that the occurrence of postoperative confusion in depressed patients is associated with an increase in plasma cortisol levels during

inredditwechatsummaryon the basis of many similarities in taxonomical characters the genera eranthis and helleborus are combined in the subtribe helleborinae ranunculaceae former investigations in comparative serology indicated that this close relationship can be dubious this work confirms earlier findings in serological characters eranthis is more similar to actaea cimicifuga than to helleborus although helleborus itself seems to have much in common with eranthis it shows unexpected strong similarities with achene fruited or annual members of the ranunculaceae myosurus adonis consolida too these results cannot be caused by undifferentiated embryos in mature seeds of eranthis even fully developed embryos show the same antigenic pattern until the beginning of germination an

glutamate receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine pcp and ketamine to humans induces a broad range of schizophrenic like symptomatology findings that have contributed to a hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia moreover a history of experimental investigations of the effects of these drugs in animals suggests that nmda receptor antagonists may model some behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia in nonhuman subjects in this review the usefulness of pcp administration as a potential animal model of schizophrenia is considered to support the contention that nmda receptor antagonist administration represents a viable model of schizophrenia the behavioral and neurobiological effects of these drugs are discussed especially with regard to differing profiles following single dose and long term exposure the neurochemical effects of nmda receptor antagonist administration are argued to support a neurobiological hypothesis of schizophrenia which includes pathophysiology within several neurotransmitter systems manifested in behavioral pathology future directions for the application of nmda receptor antagonist models of schizophrenia to preclinical and pathophysiological research are offered download pdfmainbiological psychiatric research has seen the development of many putative animal models of schizophrenia the etiological bases of these models have varied widely from the administration of purportedly psychotomimetic drugs snyder 1988 javitt and zukin 1991 jentsch et al 1998a to perinatal insults lipska et al 1993 el khodor and boksa 1997 moore and grace 1997 bertolino et al 1997 to chronic social isolation or stress jones et al 1990 and beyond the administration of psychotomimetic drugs to humans and animals represents probably the most widely accepted and utilized class of schizophrenia models these pharmacological models seem to represent methods for the induction of psychopathology in humans and aberrant potentially related behavior in animals at the behavioral level there seems to be some heterogeneity in the effects of different psychotomimetic drug classes the psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine can clearly induce a form of paranoid psychosis in human subjects after high dose or long term administration but evidence regarding the ability of these agents to induce deficit state symptoms is conflicting angrist and gershon 1970 everitt et al 1997 moreover there is evidence that amphetamine may actually alleviate negative and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients angrist et al 1982 goldberg et al 1991 carter et al 1997 psychotomimetic indoleamines such as lysergic acid diethylamide can induce profound sensory hallucinations without causing any apparent deficit state in normal subjects geyer and markou 1994 and without precipitating symptomatology in schizophrenic patients cohen et al 1962 in contrast the noncompetitive antagonists of the n methyl d aspartate nmda glutamate receptor including phencyclidine pcp and ketamine seem to be capable of inducing both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia including cognitive dysfunction in normal humans snyder 1980 javitt and zukin 1991 tamminga 1998 these drugs also profoundly exacerbate both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients itil et al 1967 lahti et al 1994 malhotra et al 1997a because of the more comprehensive psychopathology induced by pcp many researchers have studied the effects of nmda receptor antagonists in humans and animals to gain insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia in this review the validity of nmda receptor antagonist induced models of schizophrenia in humans and animals are considered and the applicability of acute versus chronic administration of pcp as a more precise model is assessed the neurobiological substrates of the observed behavioral effects in acute and chronic nmda receptor antagonist models are reviewed finally new directions for use of pcp ketamine administration as a model of schizophrenia are offered basis of the pcp ketamine models of schizophrenia in humansnearly 40 years ago it was first reported that acute administration of the noncompetitive nmda sensitive glutamate receptor antagonist pcp to normal humans induced a psychopathology with impressive similarity to certain primary symptoms of the schizophrenic process luby et al 1959 p 367 this finding has been replicated over the intervening years davies and beech 1960 cohen et al 1962 and in addition it has been found that pcp likewise exacerbates the primary symptoms of chronic schizophrenic patients luby et al 1959 itil et al 1967 controlled studies of the effects of pcp in normal and schizophrenic humans are now prohibited in part because of the overtly neurotoxic effects of this drug as determined by studies in rodents olney et al 1989 1991 olney and farber 1995 nevertheless scientists have recently utilized a pcp congener ketamine to produce a model of psychosis in humans this drug which like pcp noncompetitively blocks nmda receptors also simulates schizophrenic psychopathology in normal humans krystal et al 1994 malhotra et al 1996 and exacerbates symptoms in schizophrenic patients lahti et al 1994 malhotra et al 1997a although it seems that ketamine can induce many of the effects of pcp in humans it should be noted that ketamine is far less potent for inducing psychotomimetic reactions especially after chronic use rainey and crowder 1974 several reports have demonstrated that competitive nmda receptor antagonists are also psychotomimetic in humans bunney et al 1994 grotta et al 1995 tamminga 1998 it is important to summarize the primary symptoms of schizophrenia that may be modeled in a drug treated individual many of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia including paranoia hallucinations impulsivity formal thought disorder delusions and violent behavior are characteristic of psychotomimetic drug induced psychopathology angrist and gershon 1970 javitt and zukin 1991 ellison 1995 but pcp seems to be unique among psychostimulants because of its ability to produce negative or deficit state symptoms of schizophrenia such as emotional lability and social withdrawal in addition pcp ketamine administration can lead to profound cognitive dysfunction luby et al 1959 cohen et al 1962 pearlson 1981 javitt and zukin 1991 including impaired performance of the wisconsin card sort and continuous performance vigilance tasks and deficits in delayed recall free recall recognition memory and verbal fluency krystal et al 1994 malhotra et al 1996 many of these deficits implicate frontal lobe dysfunction krystal et al 1994 which is critical for the validity of a pcp model of schizophrenia because frontal cortical deficits are clearly a component of the schizophrenic disease process fey 1951 robbins 1990 goldman rakic 1991 weinberger and berman 1996 goldman rakic and selemon 1997 although the initial observations of nmda receptor antagonist induced psychosis were made in humans in small controlled studies of the effects of single dose exposure pcp became a popular drug of abuse within certain subcultures by the early 1960s in addition to the toxic psychosis induced by single dose administration it has also been noted that repeated use of pcp by humans induces a more persistent schizophrenic symptomatology including psychosis hallucinations flattened affect delusions formal thought disorder cognitive dysfunction and social withdrawal rainey and crowder 1975 allen and young 1978 pearlson 1981 javitt and zukin 1991 cosgrove and newell 1991 do acute and long term pcp exposure have similar consequences an important question pertains to whether the difference between the behavioral and biological effects of acute and chronic pcp exposure are more real than apparent as already noted both regimens can induce profound behavioral symptomatology reminiscent of schizophrenia in humans but there are more differences between the consequences of acute versus long term pcp administration than merely the duration of the observed effects table 1 summarizes the reported effects of acute and long term pcp ketamine exposure in humans both regimens can induce psychosis thought disorder delusions flattened affect and withdrawal with the effects of chronic exposure being generally more persistent luby et al 1959 rainey and crowder 1975 allen and young 1978 pearlson 1981 krystal et al 1994 malhotra et al 1996 the quantitative differences in the time course of the effects of the two regimens may be largely attributable to differences in dosage and route of administration studies have rarely controlled for these factors what is interesting is that there are qualitative differences between the effects of these two dosing regimens acute ketamine administration produces delusions and hallucinations typically within the visual domain krystal et al 1994 similar to lsd intoxication but not to schizophrenia geyer and markou 1994 more consistent with symptoms observed in schizophrenic patients pcp abusing humans present with religious and paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations rainey and crowder 1975 allen and young 1978 in addition long term pcp abuse is associated with emotional lability social incompetence overt impulsiveness poor social judgment poor attention span and concentration poor interpersonal relationships and social maladjustment american psychiatric association 1989 p 1217 these findings provide support for the argument that long term pcp abuse is associated with a psychopathology that is remarkably similar to schizophrenia and that may be more isomorphic to the chronic symptoms of schizophrenia e g cognitive and negative symptoms than those induced by single dose pcp exposure table 1 differing psychiatric and biological effects of acute versus long term pcp ketamine exposure in humansfull size tableother differences lie in the biological effects of pcp recent studies of regional cerebral blood flow after ketamine or pcp administration may provide clues as to the neural circuits affected by nmda receptor antagonist administration in humans acute ketamine exposure markedly increases frontal cortical blood flow especially in the anterior cingulate and frontomedial cortical regions of normal humans or schizophrenic patients lahti et al 1995 breier et al 1997a vollenweider et al 1997 in sharp contrast long term abuse of pcp by humans has been associated with reduced frontal lobe blood flow and glucose utilization hertzman et al 1990 wu et al 1991 the finding that repeated exposures to pcp reduces frontal blood flow is consistent with the observation that some components of the cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia are associated with reduced frontal blood flow so called hypofrontality ingvar and franzen 1974 weinberger et al 1986 andreasen et al 1992 weinberger and berman 1996 thus long term but not acute pcp exposure isomorphically models the behavioral and metabolic dysfunction of schizophrenia likewise previous studies have clearly shown that acute administration of pcp or ketamine to animals profoundly increases forebrain dopaminergic transmission doherty et al 1980 bowers and hoffman 1984 deutch et al 1987 hertel et al 1996 verma and moghaddam 1996 jentsch et al 1997a whereas long term pcp administration reduces frontal dopamine transmission jentsch et al 1997b c see below because hypofrontality and some cognitive deficits of schizophrenia have been associated with reduced dopamine transmission within the prefrontal cortex weinberger et al 1988 daniel et al 1989 1991 dolan et al 1995 reviewed in davis et al 1991 knable and weinberger 1997 these findings suggest that long term administration of nmda receptor antagonists produces effects that are most consistent with schizophrenia later in this review the validity of acute versus long term pcp exposure as models of schizophrenia is revisited the relative validity of animal models of schizophreniastudies of the neurochemical effects of pcp in animals in part represent the trend to utilize these drugs in nonhuman subjects to model aspects of idiopathic schizophrenia these animal studies may provide new insights regarding the pathophysiology and treatment responsivity of schizophrenia without the ethical and pragmatic constraints associated with using human experimental subjects nevertheless an insurmountable obstacle is the inability to model certain schizophrenic deficits e g those associated with verbal behavior in animals making it impossible to produce a comprehensive model of schizophrenia in nonhuman subjects despite these obvious limitations animal models may be able to reflect subsets of primary behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia for example frontal like cognitive dysfunction likewise it may be possible to mimic certain biological sequelae of schizophrenia e g hypofrontality weinberger and berman 1996 in a model system e g human pcp abusers hertzman et al 1990 another important consideration in determining the comprehensive validity of a particular animal model of schizophrenia is that the idiopathic disease likely represents a conglomeration of numerous behavioral etiological and pathophysiological factors as such a single model system may be incapable of representing all symptoms of schizophrenia reliably or comprehensively this possibility makes the prospect of multiple heterogeneous animal models a tantalizing one because different systems may confer particular insights regarding differing classes of symptoms of schizophrenia the problems associated with developing a model of schizophrenia with comprehensive face validity let alone construct validity seem daunting nevertheless as noted by geyer and markou 1994 in their review of this subject it is most important to develop and utilize model systems that 1 exhibit some symptomatic isomorphism with the idiopathic disease 2 present with dependent measures that can be objectively quantified and 3 are reproducible and robust these features can confer a particular model with characteristics sufficient to yield a pragmatically acceptable level of validity a final and perhaps most critical consideration is the predictive validity of a particular model can the model yield new and predictive insights regarding novel treatment strategies again it is important to limit the interpretation of any data within the context that a particular model system may only mimic a particular domain of symptoms and is not likely predictive of the comprehensive response of a human patient to a given treatment the pcp ketamine model of schizophrenia seems to be valid at several levels of interpretation clearly pcp or ketamine administration induces behavioral pathologies in humans that are isomorphic to certain primary symptoms of schizophrenia which are readily quantifiable and highly robust for example frontal like cognitive dysfunction luby et al 1959 javitt and zukin 1991 krystal et al 1994 in addition this model system may have demonstrable predictive validity because ketamine precipitated psychosis has been shown to be responsive to the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine malhotra et al 1997a finally mounting data in nonhuman primates see below suggests that in animals pcp may have strong face and construct validity for schizophrenia thus in the following sections we focus our discussion on many of the findings of the behavioral and biological consequences of pcp administration in animals nmda antagonist induced behavioral alterations in animals isomorphism to schizophrenia many attempts have been made to draw parallels between the behaviors exhibited by acute and chronic pcp treated animals and schizophrenic symptomatology see geyer and markou 1994 steinpreis 1996 jentsch et al 1998a for review the quantified behaviors examined occur within several different domains including locomotor behavior sensorimotor gating cognitive function motivation and social behavior the behavioral effects of pcp administration both after acute and long term administration are summarized in table 2 table 2 effects of acute versus long term exposure to pcp on rodent and primate behaviorfull size tableeffects of acute pcp administration on noncognitive behaviorseveral groups have studied the ability of acute administration of pcp or its congeners to stimulate locomotor behavior in animals freed et al 1980 carlsson 1988 carlsson and carlsson 1989 boyce et al 1991 moghaddam and adams 1998 this is based upon the notion that locomotor activity in the rodent may be a useful indicator of the propensity of a drug to elicit or exacerbate psychosis in humans p 1350 moghaddam and adams 1998 however the relationship between rodent locomotor behavior and schizophrenic symptoms lacks discriminant validity because several drugs which stimulate locomotion in rats e g alpha 2 antagonists and nicotine fail to produce or elicit psychosis in humans levin et al 1996 glazer et al 1987 in contrast delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol can produce or precipitate psychosis in normal and schizophrenic humans respectively d souza et al 1997 yet is cataleptic in rodents nevertheless dysfunction within corticostriatal pallido thalamo cortical loops produced by pcp administration may contribute to both locomotor abnormalities in pcp treated rats carlsson and carlsson 1989 and in schizophrenia robbins 1990 grace and moore 1998 single dose pcp administration to rats has also been shown to disrupt prepulse inhibition a measure of sensorimotor gating geyer et al 1984 a finding with isomorphism to startle gating deficits of schizophrenic patients geyer and braff 1987 braff et al 1992 in this paradigm the delivery a stimulus that normally causes startle in animals or humans a mild shock or very loud tone is presaged by a neutral stimulus in normal humans and animals the delivery of the neutral stimulus results in reduced startle in contrast pcp treated animals and schizophrenics both exhibit an inability to attenuate their startle response with the presentation of the neutral warning stimulus the face validity of the prepulse inhibition paradigm for modeling schizophrenic sensorimotor gating deficits has been well established geyer and markou 1994 acute pcp administration has also been shown to reduce social interactions in rats steinpreis et al 1994 sams dodd 1995 1996 and monkeys miller et al 1973 schlemmer and davis 1983 although these effects seem to bear relationship to the social deficits exhibited by schizophrenic subjects it would be informative to know whether these drug induced effects occur independent of nonspecific alterations in general locomotion and arousal moreover it is possible that rodent social interactive behavior is a measure that has a problematic relationship with schizophrenic social withdrawal i e the measured construct is not the same it seems that deficits in social interactions in schizophrenic subjects are not a primary symptom of the disorder per se but rather are secondary to a variety of other symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction flattened affect primary thought disorder impulsivity and psychosis dickerson et al 1996 thus care should be exercised when drawing parallels between the social dysfunction of schizophrenia and that of pcp treated rodents effects of acute pcp administration on cognitive behaviorattempts to study cognitive functions in pcp treated animals may yield the more informative results for several reasons the performance of cognitive tasks by animals and humans may depend on similar neural and psychological constructs and the validity of the particular tasks may be directly assessed second measures of cognitive behavior in animals can be frankly objective especially when automated testing or highly controlled task circumstances are used finally much is known about the cognitive constructs subserved by particular brain regions e g working memory function in prefrontal cortex monkeys goldman rakic 1987 humans courtney et al 1998 and a variety of behavioral tasks can be used to measure the same construct e g delayed response delayed nonmatch to sample with repeated objects n back tasks self ordered tasks thus different procedures can be used in humans and animals if necessary to measure similar constructs in consideration of the above we focus much of our subsequent discussion on cognitive functions in nmda receptor antagonist treated animals as models of schizophrenic cognitive dysfunction many studies have examined the effects of acute nmda receptor antagonist administration on cognitive functions although schizophrenia is certainly associated with fairly wide ranging deficits it is unclear whether the global impairments caused by pcp administration are comprehensively representative of schizophrenic deficits administration of pcp ketamine or mk 801 another noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist to rats has been shown to impair performance on tasks that seem to depend upon hippocampal or amygdalar function for example passive avoidance acquisition of the morris water maze task or a conditional discrimination or performance of a spatial continuous recognition memory task heale and harley 1990 jones et al 1990 kesner and davis 1993 murray and ridley 1997 in addition although delayed alternation deficits have been reported after ketamine and mk 801 suggesting spatial working memory dysfunction verma and moghaddam 1996 spontaneous no delay alternation is likewise affected fraser et al 1997 complicating this interpretation furthermore administration of noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonists has been shown to impair even simple behavioral measures such as acquisition of a conditioned emotional response hoehn saric et al 1991 of a flavor aversion aguado et al 1994 of an operant response pallares et al 1995 of a brightness discrimination tang and franklin 1983 tang and ho 1988 or of a conditioned cue preference stevens et al 1997 because many of these latter tasks depend largely upon simple sensory processes and associative learning which are relatively preserved in schizophrenic patients the specificity of cognitive deficits in animals acutely treated with pcp ketamine mk 801 is questionable it is important to comment that acute pcp administration to monkeys similarly impairs performance of working memory tasks in a delay independent fashion boyce et al 1991 hudzik and wenger 1993 visual recognition tasks ogura and aigner 1993 conditional discrimination tasks moerschbaecher and thompson 1980 and tasks that measure motivation and other nonspecific effects frederick et al 1995 thus care should be taken when arguing for complete isomorphism between acute nmda receptor antagonist induced behavioral deficits in animals and the symptoms of schizophrenia effects of long term pcp administration on noncognitive behavioras previously discussed the effects of chronic rather than acute exposure to pcp may better represent some facets of schizophrenia thus it is important to understand the behavioral cognitive consequences of long term exposure to pcp in animals although few investigators have explored the behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with chronic pcp administration initial examinations see below suggest that a more selective set of impairments results from long term dosing altered social behavior locomotor sensitization and cognitive function might be expected to be altered in chronic pcp treated animals if the effects of pcp represent a possible model of schizophrenia social deficits have been reported in rats after cessation of long term pcp administration steinpreis et al 1994 sams dodd 1995 1996 although it is not presently clear how enduring these effects are behavioral sensitization is a phenomenon whereby repeated exposures to a drug or environmental stimulus lead to progressively enhanced behavioral responses a sensitization hypothesis of schizophrenia has been offered in an attempt to describe psychomotor stimulant induced psychosis and stress precipitated psychopathology robinson and becker 1986 post et al 1988 lieberman et al 1997 pcp induced sensitization of limbic circuits might have relevance to the neurobiology of schizophrenia as sensitization to the locomotor stimulating effects of pcp ketamine and mk 801 has been reported scalzo and holson 1992 wolf and khansa 1991 xu and domino 1994 importantly this phenomenon seems to be very dose and regimen sensitive and may be complicated by tolerance to the ataxic effects of pcp melnick et al 1997 augmented locomotor responsivity to stress and d amphetamine has been reported after long term pcp exposure jentsch et al 1998c and subchronic ketamine administration has been shown to increase apomorphine induced stereotypy lannes et al 1991 furthermore we have observed that subchronic pcp exposure leads to an increased mesolimbic dopamine response after an acute administration of haloperidol jentsch et al 1998c therefore at least a component of limbic circuitry the mesolimbic dopamine system does seem to show augmented function after long term nmda receptor antagonist exposure however it is not currently apparent that this is attributable to a simple sensitization phenomenon because the locomotor response to pcp itself is reduced after the drug administration regimen used in our studies jentsch and taylor unpublished observations thus although locomotor sensitization may yield some insights regarding subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity it may not be a prerequisite of this hyperactivity effects of long term pcp administration on cognitive behaviorrecently the cognitive effects of long term pcp treatment in rats and monkeys have been investigated the initial results would suggest that dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex principally dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in monkeys and medial frontal cortex in rats is a component of these deficits because working memory is clearly one cognitive function subserved by frontal cortex goldman rakic 1987 we have examined the performance of a spatial delayed alternation task by rats after subchronic pcp administration in this task rats are required to maneuver through a t maze to obtain a reward on the first trial the rat is rewarded for entering either arm and on subsequent trials the reward is only given if the rat alternates between entering the two arms e g left right left etc because a delay period is interposed between trials the rat is required to briefly maintain information regarding the next choice on line thus requiring the working memory construct this task is closely linked with the function of the frontal cortex and its dopaminergic innervation brozoski et al 1979 kolb 1984 goldman rakic 1987 bubser and schmidt 1990 roberts et al 1994 long term pcp administration produces delay dependent performance impairments on a variable delay spatial t maze alternation task jentsch et al 1997b because deficits were minimal at short 0 s delays and greater at longer delays these data seem to implicate specific working memory dysfunction another frontal function that contributes to successful performance of the spatial delayed alternation task is response inhibition diamond 1988 1996 and robbins 1996 have both eloquently described a role for response inhibition in delayed response tasks in these tasks the subject must simultaneously maintain information about the next choice on line and also inhibit the tendency to make a choice that was previously rewarded but which is no longer appropriate a prepotent response this cognitive function has been most closely linked with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex based upon lesion studies in nonhuman primates iversen and mishkin 1970 dias et al 1996a as with delayed response another task with components of response inhibition motor planning and working memory and that is sensitive to frontal lobe lesions is object retrieval detour the object retrieval detour task can be used to assess cognitive function in humans or monkeys diamond 1988 1996 taylor et al 1990a b this task involves the retrieval of a reward from behind a transparent barrier and thus requires several frontal lobe functions including response inhibition the need to block the pre potent tendency to make a direct reach for the reward through the transparent barrier motor planning the formation of a complex motor act for retrieval of the reward and perhaps working memory the guidance of reaching behavior by memory knowledge or representation rather than simple visual feedback thus ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal as well as premotor cortices may contribute to successful task performance frontal involvement in this task is implicated by impaired performance after widespread lesions of frontal lobe moll and kuypers 1977 more specific ablation of the lateral and orbital frontal regions dias et al 1996b or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex diamond and goldman rakic 1985 diamond 1988 1996 in monkeys in contrast parietal cortical or hippocampal lesions fail to affect object retrieval performance diamond and goldman rakic 1985 diamond et al 1989 diamond 1988 1996 furthermore impaired performance of this task is exhibited by monkeys after mptp induced reductions in dopamine concentrations within the striatal complex taylor et al 1990a b thus this task seems to measure several constructs frontal lobe function response inhibition working memory response planning impaired in schizophrenia monkeys that are repeatedly exposed to pcp are impaired in acquisition and performance of this retrieval task during the acquisition phase drug treated subjects fail to acquire the reaching strategy necessary to perform the task as do frontal lesioned or mptp treated monkeys moll and kuypers 1977 diamond and goldman rakic 1985 diamond 1988 taylor et al 1990a b dias et al 1996b furthermore pcp treated monkeys are disinhibited they tend to attempt to reach through the transparent barrier to retrieve the reward and are also specifically perseverative in response jentsch et al 1997c importantly performance of the object retrieval detour task is impaired in pcp treated subjects only when monkeys need to negotiate the barrier and thus inhibit the prepotent response and maintain on line sequences of responses and not on special trials that require nothing more than visually guided behavior furthermore no motor or motivational deficits have been found using task related measures in pcp treated monkeys jentsch et al 1997c these data suggest that unlike acute pcp exposure cognitive impulsivity impaired working memory and perseveration but not nonspecific effects are consequences of repeated exposures to pcp conclusionsthese data on the effects of long term pcp administration on rats and monkeys are suggestive of a more selective cognitive deficit profile than that exhibited by animals treated with a single dose of the drug the initial evidence seems to suggest that frontal lobe function is particularly affected after long term treatment and withdrawal because schizophrenics show particularly profound and pronounced deficits on tasks linked with frontal lobe function see below fey 1951 robbins 1990 goldman rakic 1991 park and holzman 1992 with spared performance on simple associative processes the cognitive consequences of long term administration may more isomorphically model the frontal lobe deficits associated with schizophrenia frontal cortical dysfunction relevance to the pcp modelas noted the behavioral deficits in schizophrenic patients are strongly reminiscent of frontal lobe dysfunction frontal lobe lesions in humans and monkeys are associated with cognitive dysfunction flattened affect social withdrawal impulsivity and perseveration goldman and rosvold 1970 fuster 1997 goldman rakic 1987 1991 petrides 1996 robbins 1990 1996 some specific discussion of the characteristic cognitive deficits exhibited by frontal lobe lesioned subjects is important when interpreting the previously summarized data goldman rakic petrides fuster and robbins have each described working memory deficits following lesions to the frontal lobe specifically the dorsolateral frontal cortex goldman rakic 1991 petrides 1996 robbins 1996 fuster 1997 goldman rakic 1987 1991 has postulated that working memory constitutes a generalized function of the anatomical subdivisions of frontal cortex that operate in parallel within distinct domains and petrides 1996 has described the function of the midventrolateral frontal cortex as the retrieval of information from long term memory and thus this system would be integral to the function of the working memory system dorsolateral prefrontal cortex providing access to memories that must be integrated with incoming sensory information along with on line processing systems robbins 1996 has further argued for a distributed system within frontal cortex subserving inhibitory response control fuster 1997 has also described a motor planning function to prefrontal cortex complementing the on line processing and self ordering functions of this brain region thus lesions within frontal lobe would be hypothesized to impair working memory and response inhibition and this is indeed the case milner 1963 1982 freedman and oscar berman 1986 petrides and milner 1982 verin et al 1993 at present subchronic pcp treated rats and monkeys seem to exhibit deficits in working memory and inhibitory control in contrast relatively simple sensory and associative processes seem preserved although schizophrenic patients exhibit cognitive deficits that likely result from dysfunction with temporal and parietal as well as frontal cortices goldberg and gold 1995 it remains to be seen whether long term pcp administration causes a cognitive deficit syndrome that includes extrafrontal dysfunction as subchronic pcp exposure seems to induce a syndrome of behavioral deficits consistent with frontal cortical dysfunction it is perhaps most useful to describe long term pcp administration as a potential model of schizophrenic frontal cortical dysfunction nevertheless pcp clearly exerts pharmacological and neurochemical effects on numerous cortical regions see below so dysfunction within extrafrontal cortical regions is likely indeed schizophrenics and ketamine treated individuals exhibit impaired declarative memory a dysfunction possibly associated with altered mesial temporal function krystal et al 1994 malhotra et al 1996 so it remains to be seen whether chronic pcp treatment leads to deficits within this mnemonic modiality neurobiological substrates of pcp ketamine models of schizophreniaas previously described the effect of pcp to block nmda receptors supports a hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia in this section we review more comprehensively the neurochemical neuroanatomical and neurophysiological effects of pcp to develop a hypothetical substrate for impaired cognition in pcp treated subjects an understanding of the full effects of pcp is important when constructing a neurobiological hypothesis of schizophrenia neurochemistrycortical dopamine dysfunctionseveral neurotransmitter systems in frontal lobe modulate cognitive functions the most well studied likely being dopamine in a seminal series of studies goldman rakic and colleagues observed preferentially high concentrations of dopamine within the primate prefrontal cortex brown and goldman 1977 and showed that large reductions in dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the monkey induced by 6 hydroxydopamine infusion led to impairments of spatial delayed alternation a working memory task brozoski et al 1979 these deficits were equivalent to those seen after ablative lesions of this brain region goldman et al 1971 furthermore dopamine d1 receptors within prefrontal cortex have been shown to be involved in working memory because intraprefrontal cortical infusion or systemic administration of specific dopamine d1 receptor antagonists impaired oculomotor or manual spatial delayed response respectively sawaguchi and goldman rakic 1991 arnsten et al 1994 in addition increased dopamine release in monkey prefrontal cortex is specifically associated with performance of spatial delayed alteration as opposed to performance of a control task watanabe et al 1997 in contrast performance of an attentional set shift task a test of inhibitory control dias et al 1996a 1997 was improved by dopamine specific lesions of the lateral frontal cortex in marmosets roberts et al 1994 in addition as previously discussed object retrieval detour has been shown to be sensitive to mptp induced reductions in corticostriatal dopamine levels taylor et al 1990a b schneider and kovelowski 1990 and is known to be impaired after long term pcp administration in monkeys jentsch et al 1997c thus dopamine seems to exert a critical neuromodulatory influence on a subset of the cognitive functions of frontal lobe and thus it remains possible that dopaminergic dysfunction results in the deficits in animals after subchronic pcp administration is it possible that the pcp induced dysregulation of frontal cortical dopamine transmission contributes to the associated drug induced frontal cortical dysfunction our recent observations support this notion see below as noted above acute administration of noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonists is associated with a dramatic activation of dopamine transmission in forebrain doherty et al 1980 bowers and hoffman 1984 deutch et al 1987 hertel et al 1996 verma and moghaddam 1996 jentsch et al 1997a and this effect is likely directly implicated in the cognitive dysfunction exhibited by subjects acutely treated with pcp or ketamine verma and moghaddam 1996 because increased dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortex has been reported to impair spatial working memory murphy et al 1996a jentsch et al 1997d in rodents an acute dose of pcp seems to augment prefrontal cortical and ventral striatal dopamine transmission whereas the dopaminergic innervation of the dorsal striatum is relatively unaffected deutch et al 1987 jentsch et al 1997a in the monkey we measured marked increases in frontal cortical dopamine utilization in pcp treated monkeys but no change was noted in any subcortical region including the nucleus accumbens jentsch et al 1997a acute pcp administration has also been reported to activate serotonergic glutamatergic noradrenergic cholinergic and neurotensinergic transmission in rodents and monkeys see below deutch et al 1987 hertel et al 1996 jentsch et al 1997a previously it was suggested that inhibition of dopamine re uptake was directly implicated in the acute pcp induced increases in extracellular levels of dopamine in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens mccullough and salamone 1992 steinpreis and salamone 1993 hondo et al 1994 however several lines of data refute this hypothesis the activation of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens induced by acute pcp administration is blocked by such agents as ha966 prazosin and clonidine mathe et al 1996 jentsch et al 1997a 1998b which modulate the firing patterns of dopaminergic neurons within the ventral mesencephalon shepard et al 1996 grenhoff and svensson 1989 1993 and by intraprefrontal cortical administration of tetrodotoxin nishijima et al 1996 likewise pcp itself increases the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons freedman and bunney 1984 french 1994 the available data suggest that acute administration of pcp may reduce cortical gabaergic function grunze et al 1994 yonezawa et al 1998 disinhibiting glutamatergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex moghaddam et al 1997 and ventral tegmental area mathe et al 1998 this increase in glutamatergic transmission would then stimulate mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic transmission and locomotor behavior jentsch et al 1998d given the effects of acute pcp treatment on dopamine transmission and the modulation of cognitive function by this transmitter we examined dopamine transmission after subchronic pcp exposure in rats and monkeys in stark contrast to the consequences of acute pcp exposure we found that repeated intermittent pcp administrations reduce dopamine turnover in the prefrontal cortex of rats and monkeys jentsch et al 1997b c repeated exposures of pcp to rats cause a marked to approximately 75 of control levels and persistent at least 3 week reduction in basal resting dopamine utilization dihydroxy o phenyl acetic acid dopac dopamine ratio in the medial prefrontal cortex but not nucleus accumbens or striatum jentsch et al 1997b 1998c this effect of pcp seems to be mediated in part by nmda antagonism because a similar if smaller reduction in dopamine transmission in rat prefrontal cortex was noted after subchronic mk 801 administration jentsch et al 1998c in addition repeated treatment seems to be required because single injection of pcp failed to alter dopamine transmission enduringly in the prefrontal cortex the pcp induced alterations in metabolite dopamine ratio are caused almost entirely by changes in concentrations of metabolite jentsch et al 1997b c the lack of pcp induced change in tissue concentrations of dopamine itself suggests that no direct neurotoxic insult to dopamine neurons occurs during subchronic pcp administration presumably a loss of dopamine neurons would be indicated by a loss of dopamine content in the terminal fields of these projection neurons but no sign of this is currently apparent this finding does not rule out the possibility that populations of cells in other regions of the brain including those that project to prefrontal cortex or the ventral midbrain dopaminergic nuclei are subject to pcp induced neurotoxicity the effects of long term pcp exposure in the monkey forebrain are even more profound and anatomically localized subchronic pcp treatment enduringly at least 9 days reduces dopamine utilization homovanillic acid hva dopamine ratio in several regions of monkey frontal cortex jentsch et al 1997c 1998e affected areas include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex walker s area 46 medial prefrontal cortex area 9 frontal eye fields area 8a lateral orbital cortex area 12 infragranular cortex area 14 and prelimbic ventromedial limbic frontal cortex areas 25 32 33 in contrast no drug induced changes are observed in the supplementary motor area area 6m primary motor cortex area 4 or rostral frontal pole area 10 in addition dopaminergic transmission in other cortical areas amygdala and entorhinal cortices and subcortical regions nucleus accumbens core and shell caudate nucleus putamen septal nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus are unaffected thus the effects are strikingly restricted to frontal cortex these findings may not be completely analogous to schizophrenia as akil and lewis 1995 1996 have found dopaminergic abnormalities in both frontal and entorhinal cortical areas furthermore we have recently noted that the extent of dopaminergic inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal and prelimbic frontal regions correlates significantly with the degree of performance impairment on the object retrieval detour task in pcp treated monkeys jentsch et al 1998e while successful performance does not correlate with dopamine transmission in other frontal cortical or subcortical brain regions likewise serotonin transmission in any brain region is not significantly related to successful performance of this task thus these data implicate dopaminergic dysfunction with specific frontal regions in the performance of the object retrieval detour task the pcp induced changes in basal resting dopamine metabolism are mirrored in the dopaminergic response to stimulation acute mild stress increases dopamine transmission in the rodent prefrontal cortex deutch and roth 1990 however the dopaminergic response to stress is markedly reduced in the prefrontal cortices of rats that have been subchronically exposed to pcp jentsch et al 1997b in addition we have noted that the increase in dopamine release and metabolism induced by an acute pcp challenge is reduced after long term pcp exposure in rats and monkeys jentsch et al 1997c 1998f thus it seems that both basal and stimulated dopamine function are reduced by subchronic pcp exposure in an attempt to relate these changes in dopamine turnover to transmitter efflux we have recently examined the effects of long term pcp treatment on extracellular concentrations of dopamine in rodent prefrontal cortex a dose regimen that reduces the dopac dopamine ratio in prefrontal cortex jentsch et al 1997b 1998c dramatically reduced basal extracellular dopamine concentrations to 60 of control levels in the prefrontal cortex jentsch et al 1998f in contrast lindefors et al 1997 recently reported that repeated administration of ketamine to rats increased basal resting extracellular levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex although this finding is seemingly inconsistent with our finding of reduced dopaminergic function after repeated exposures to pcp several issues concerning this study should be noted first lindefors et al 1997 used once daily injections of a relatively moderate dose 25 mg kg of ketamine a drug with a considerably shorter half life than that of pcp this administration regimen would likely be associated with widely oscillating plasma levels of ketamine in our studies we generally used twice daily administration of moderate doses of pcp a paradigm likely associated given the longer half life of pcp with continuously elevated though waxing and waning plasma levels of pcp this pharmacokinetic difference may be a critical determining factor in the net effects of drug administration on prefrontal dopamine transmission another factor complicating the interpretation of the results of lindefors et al 1997 arises from their finding that repeated ketamine administration results in increased basal resting extracellular concentrations of dopamine but not dopac or hva in the prefrontal cortex however after repeated ketamine exposures a single dose ketamine challenge fails to elevate dopamine efflux beyond the heightened baseline but increases extracellular dopac and hva it is difficult to construct a mechanistic hypothesis of how functional changes in neurotransmission per se would underlie the specific changes in extracellular dopamine reported by lindefors et al 1997 thus it appears that in contrast to previous speculations adams and moghaddam 1998 dopaminergic function as measured by in vivo release or ex vivo metabolite measures is reduced after a dosing regimen of pcp that produces demonstrable frontal cortical cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodents the neurochemical differences reported highlight the need for examining behavioral and neurobiological function after identical treatments particularly with regard to pharmacological models the reduction in dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex of pcp treated rats and monkeys should be viewed within the context of potential changes in postsynaptic dopamine receptor density previously it was shown that subchronic exposure to mk 801 reduced dopamine d1 receptor mrna in the rat prefrontal cortex healy and meador woodruff 1996a b likewise in a preliminary study we have obtained evidence for reduced dopamine d1 mrna levels in the monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after subchronic pcp treatment jentsch lidow roth and goldman rakic unpublished observations these findings suggest that the functional effects of reductions in the synaptic release of dopamine are exacerbated by a loss of a dopamine receptor that seems to be critical to the working memory functions of prefrontal cortex sawaguchi and goldman rakic 1991 the reduction in cortical dopamine transmission both at the pre and postsynaptic level in the chronic pcp model seems to be consistent with some findings in schizophrenic patients first the reduction in metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients is inversely correlated with cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of homovanillic acid a measure of central dopaminergic transmission weinberger et al 1988 second hypofrontality in schizophrenia is alleviated by systemic administration of indirect or direct dopaminergic agonists such as amphetamine daniel et al 1991 or apomorphine daniel et al 1989 dolan et al 1995 finally a recent positron emission tomographic pet study has suggested that the dopamine d1 receptor may be downregulated in schizophrenia okubo et al 1997 thus it seems that one component of the cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia is associated with reduced frontal dopaminergic transmission this potential biological sequela of the disorder would be consistent with a chronic pcp model of schizophrenia but would be at face value inconsistent with an activation of dopamine transmission induced by acute pcp ketamine administration subcortical dopamine dysfunctionas previously discussed some effects of acute pcp administration on subcortical dopamine transmission especially in the nucleus accumbens of rats have been reported doherty et al 1980 deutch et al 1987 hertel et al 1996 jentsch et al 1997a in contrast we failed to find any effect of single dose pcp exposure on subcortical dopamine utilization in the monkey jentsch et al 1997a the activation in accumbens dopamine transmission in the rat has been associated with the ability of pcp to stimulate locomotor behavior mccullough and salamone 1992 steinpreis and salamone 1993 jentsch et al 1998d and may be associated with some psychopathology in pcp treated humans it could be hypothesized that reduced cortical dopamine transmission induced by long term pcp exposure may be associated with a hyperactivity of subcortical dopamine systems as with acute administration because the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems demonstrate an inverse relationship in animals that is hypoactivity of the cortical dopamine system propagates subcortical dopamine hyperactivity pycock et al 1980 deutch et al 1990 grace 1991 deutch 1992 roberts et al 1994 although no changes in basal resting dopamine utilization in the nucleus accumbens were noted after subchronic treatment with pcp jentsch et al 1997b c we have now found that the mesolimbic dopamine pathway has increased responsivity to haloperidol d amphetamine or mild stress jentsch et al 1998c because the dopamine innervation of the striatal complex also seems to be involved in cognitive functioning taylor et al 1990a b schneider and kovelowski 1990 a dysregulation of the subcortical dopamine system by subchronic pcp exposure might also be related to impaired cognitive function in fact roberts et al 1994 have previously hypothesized that enhanced attentional set shifting performance after 6 hydroxydopamine lesions of the prefrontal cortex is mediated by subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity it is noteworthy in this regard that subcortical dopaminergic function shows the opposite pattern of response to long term pcp as compared to cortical regions subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity has also been suggested in schizophrenia see davis et al 1991 grace 1991 deutch 1992 recently support for this hypothesis has come from the demonstration that administration of d amphetamine results in an augmented release of dopamine within the striatal complex of schizophrenic patients relative to controls laruelle et al 1996 breier et al 1997b these findings are consistent with the original dopamine hyperactivity hypothesis of schizophrenia carlsson and lindqvist 1963 creese et al 1976 and taken with our findings of cortical dopaminergic hypoactivity are consistent with several revised dopamine hypotheses of schizophrenia carlsson 1988 davis et al 1991 knable and weinberger 1997 thus the chronic pcp model may represent a functional drug induced embodiment of the cortical subcortical dopamine interaction hypothesis of schizophrenia robbins 1990 grace 1991 deutch 1992 serotonin and norepinephrine systemsserotonin and norepinephrine dysfunction have also been implicated in schizophrenia meltzer 1995 breier et al 1998 and norepinephrine as does dopamine seems to modulate frontal cortical function arnsten and goldman rakic 1985 arnsten and jentsch 1997 whereas little is known about serotonergic effects on prefrontal cortical cognition thus it is perhaps worth restating that no changes in norepinephrine or serotonin metabolism were noted in monkeys or rats respectively after long term pcp treatment jentsch et al 1997b c as previously stated this further implicates a selective change in neurotransmission in the reduced dopamine metabolism after repeated pcp exposures in contrast to the effects of subchronic exposure acute administration of pcp clearly augments noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission deutch et al 1987 jentsch et al 1997a martin et al 1998 dysfunction within these systems then may be linked to the aberrant behavior of humans and animals acutely exposed to pcp or ketamine glutamatergic and gabaergic dysfunctionalterations in glutamatergic and gabaergic function within prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia have been proposed by a number of researchers benes et al 1991 akbarian et al 1995 selemon et al 1995 lewis and anderson 1995 bartha et al 1997 tamminga 1998 because these transmitters constitute the currency of cortico cortical circuitry dysfunction within these systems should result in significantly impaired function of affected cortical regions the pcp ketamine model of schizophrenia coupled with other findings became the hallmark of a hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia javitt and zukin 1991 bunney et al 1994 tamminga 1998 these ideas are supported by the finding that schizophrenic patients had lower cerebrospinal fluid glutamate concentrations than controls kim et al 1980 however this finding remains controversial e g perry 1982 failed to find such an effect furthermore glutamate receptors have been reported to be increased in schizophrenia an effect presumably secondary to reduced glutamate transmission toru et al 1994 although acute pcp or ketamine administration may be associated with blockade and net hypoactivity of the nmda receptor the comprehensive effects of these drugs on cortical circuitry are complicated by the finding that acute administration of ketamine or pcp dramatically increases cortical glutamate and dopamine efflux moghaddam et al 1997 possibly leading to hyperactivation of non nmda glutamate receptors this hyperactivation of glutamatergic transmission at non nmda receptors is a component of olney and farber s 1995 nmda receptor hypofunction hypothesis of pcp induced psychosis this could also explain the seemingly paradoxical finding that acute ingestion of high doses of pcp although reducing nmda associated transmission can be proconvulsant gorelick and balster 1994 indeed moghaddam and colleagues moghaddam et al 1997 have argued that the increase in cortical glutamate efflux after acute nmda antagonist administration a net potentiation of transmission at non nmda glutamate receptors produces the increase in dopamine release since intra cortical administration of an ampa receptor antagonist blocked the ketamine induced increase in cortical dopamine release this is complementary to the finding that injection of the same ampa antagonist into the cell body regions of the dopamine neurons likewise attenuates pcp induced biochemical and behavioral abnormalities mathe et al 1998 thus increased glutamatergic transmission via non nmda glutamate receptors has been hypothesized to underlie a portion of the pcp induced behavioral and neurochemical dysfunctions this concept is not however supported by a recent study by moghaddam and adams 1998 in which systemic administration of a group ii metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist was shown to prevent the pcp induced augmentation in cortical glutamate release without blocking the increase in cortical dopamine efflux moreover taken together with the result that dopamine receptor antagonism alone ameliorates pcp induced cognitive dysfunction verma and moghaddam 1996 it appears that cortical glutamate release after nmda antagonist administration may not be necessary or sufficient to produce altered prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux and associated cognitive deficits further evidence for pcp effects on nmda and non nmda glutamatergic systems comes from the elegant studies of tamminga and colleagues this group has shown that acute administration of pcp results in biphasic changes in brain glucose metabolism and glutamate receptor density studies of the uptake of 2 deoxyglucose in the brains of pcp treated rats have revealed a short lived on the order of several hours increase in forebrain metabolic activity followed by a longer lasting reduction in metabolism which lasts about 2 days gao et al 1993 in addition nmda receptor binding in the hippocampus is transiently decreased at 3 h and subsequently increased for approximately 2 days after single dose pcp administration gao and tamminga 1996 interestingly the transient metabolic and glutamatergic effects of pcp are most closely temporally associated with symptom production in ketamine treated schizophrenic subjects lahti et al 1994 and are consistent with increased limbic blood flow in patients lahti et al 1995 of course it is the early effects that are most closely linked with the ketamine induced psychosis and cognitive impairments because these effects are largely short lived on the order of hours krystal et al 1994 schizophrenia also seems to involve a component of gabaergic dysfunction morphometric studies have found abnormalities in local circuit neurons within the schizophrenic cingulate cortex benes et al 1991 and this alteration may actually represent increased cell packing density in the absence of changes in gaba neuron number indicative of reduced neuropil selemon et al 1995 furthermore schizophrenic prefrontal cortex may show reduced levels of gad67 the enzyme responsible for gaba synthesis akbarian et al 1995 and altered axonal terminals of gabaergic chandelier cells woo et al 1998 these data strongly suggest that dysfunction of local circuit neurons which utilize gaba as a transmitter is a component of schizophrenic pathophysiology the acute pcp ketamine model of schizophrenia may also incorporate gabaergic dysfunction in a slice preparation of rat hippocampal ca1 neurons it has been shown that mk 801 preferentially reduces alvear stimulation induced long term potentiation in local circuit neurons relative to pyramidal cells grunze et al 1994 suggesting that the nmda receptor antagonists preferentially reduce gabaergic transmission this indeed seems to be the case because in prefrontal cortex pcp increases glutamate release moghaddam et al 1997 whereas profoundly reducing gaba release yonezawa et al 1998 these findings concur with the hypothesis that nmda receptors primarily regulate the function of local circuit gabaergic neurons olney and farber 1995 as previously discussed the effects of long term pcp treatment may represent a superior model of schizophrenic frontal lobe dysfunction therefore it is important to understand changes in glutamatergic and gabaergic activity in animals repeatedly treated with pcp although little is known about this subject preliminary evidence suggests that both glutamatergic and gabaergic systems may be dysfunctional in animals subchronically exposed to pcp in a pattern roughly analogous to schizophrenia in recent studies wang and colleagues have recorded from pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortices of rats that had been subchronically treated with pcp and this group has found heightened depolarization of pyramidal neurons after the application of exogenous nmda in the drug treated rats relative to controls arvanov and wang 1998 one interpretation of these data is that prolonged reduction in glutamatergic transmission in prefrontal cortex of drug treated rats is associated with an upregulation of nmda receptors and thus the response to exogenous nmda application is amplified to confirm this hypothesis it would be essential to monitor directly extracellular glutamate levels in vivo and to measure the expression of the subunits of the nmda receptor after long term pcp treatment increased expression of glur1 a subunit of the ampa receptor and nmdari have been shown in rat prefrontal cortex after repeated exposures to but not acute administration of pcp tomita et al 1995 wang et al 1998 it is also notable that no significant difference in ampa receptor subunit mrna levels were observed in either cortical or striatal regions of elderly schizophrenic patients healy et al 1998 whereas a significant increase in nmdar1 and nmdar2a sununit mrnas were measured in prefrontal cortex of the same subjects meador woodruff et al 1997 as noted above gaba interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in schizophrenia two main pieces of evidence suggest the same in a chronic nmda receptor antagonist model first reduced levels of gad67 the enzyme responsible for gaba synthesis were found in the mouse frontal cortex after subchronic mk 801 exposure qin et al 1994 as in schizophrenia likewise long term exposure to mk 801 has been reported to reduce local circuit inhibition in the ca1 fields enduringly of the rat hippocampus grunze et al 1997 it remains to be seen whether morphometric changes in local circuit neurons akin to those observed in the brains of schizophrenic patients are also observed after subchronic pcp exposure cholinergic dysfunctionanother critical neuromodulatory influence on cognitive function is exerted by the ascending acetylcholinergic innervation of the forebrain moreover a hypercholinergic hypothesis of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia has been promoted tandon and greden 1989 acute administration of pcp to rats seems to increase acetylcholinergic transmission profoundly as revealed by a hypercholinergic mechanism in the neurotoxic effects of pcp olney et al 1991 in addition single dose administration has been observed to increase cortical acetylcholine turnover murray and cheney 1981 and release in the rat giovannini et al 1994 hutson and hogg 1996 dazzi et al 1998 little is known about the effects of chronic administration of pcp on cholinergic systems hsu et al 1980 showed that an acute administration of pcp increased the activity of the cholinergic synthetic and catabolic enzymes choline acetyl transferase and acetylcholinesterase respectively and that chronic administration of pcp tended to reduce the ability of a subsequent pcp challenge to activate these enzymes to the same degree as a single dose pcp challenge it is important to note however that this weak tolerance to these effects of pcp is not necessarily predictive of the functional activity of cholinergic enzymes either under basal or environmentally challenged e g stress conditions further studies of cholinergic transmission after chronic pcp are necessary to elucidate how cholinergic systems may be dysregulated in this animal model recent studies have shown that dopaminergic activation increases cortical acetylcholine release day and fibiger 1992 1993 and recent studies have suggested that this modulatory effect is mediated by dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens moore et al 1998 because subcortical dopaminergic transmission seems to be augmented after long term pcp administration cholinergic hyperactivity in prefrontal cortex may be a consequence of this pharmacological model on going studies are directed at assessing this hypothesis neuroanatomyneurotoxicity of nmda receptor antagoniststhe elegant work of olney and colleagues see olney and farber 1995 for review has focused on the neurotoxic effects of nmda receptor hypofunction and the potential implications of this phenomenon for schizophrenia this group originally reported the critical finding that exposure to noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonists transiently injured neurons within the retrosplenial cortex of the rat as revealed by cytoplasmic vacuolization olney et al 1989 in a recent study corso et al 1997 showed that this damage is largely reversible only after administration of extremely high doses 50 mg kg of pcp does irreversible cell death demonstrated by agyrophilia occur in addition even after high dose administration damage in most cases is largely limited to such limbic cortical regions as the retrosplenial piriform entorhinal insular amygdalar and hippocampal cortices corso et al 1997 nevertheless the transient damage within limbic cortex regions may be associated with the acute neurochemical changes induced by single dose pcp administration at least a component of the acute pcp induced neurotoxicity may be mediated by hyperactivation of dopaminergic systems for example several studies have demonstrated that dopamine receptor antagonists prevent pcp induced cellular damage farber et al 1993 1996 in addition the neurotoxicity is prevented by administration of 2 noradrenergic agonists farber et al 1995 which have been shown to block the pcp induced increases in forebrain dopamine transmission jentsch et al 1998b these data suggest that hyperactivation of dopamine transmission may participate in the pathway from single dose pcp administration to neuronal damage cellular death is more frequently a consequence of repeated exposure to nmda receptor antagonists ellison and colleagues 1993 1994 have shown that chronic administration of high doses 15 mg kg of pcp by means of osmotic minipumps induced a pattern of neurotoxicity in limbic brain regions similar to those damaged by high dose acute pcp administration olney et al 1989 corso et al 1997 because persistent neurotoxicity and spatial learning deficits have been shown in mice treated with a single high dose of mk801 wozniak et al 1996 it is possible that pcp induced neurotoxicity is a neural substrate of cognitive dysfunction in this putative animal model of psychosis electrophysiologypcp induced changes in cortical gating of accumbal neuronsthe groundbreaking work of grace and colleagues has led to the development of a hypothetical circuit by which hippocampal and amygdalar efferents can modulate or gate prefrontal cortical input to nucleus accumbens neurons briefly stimulation of the hippocampus or amygdala significantly facilitates the ability of prefrontal stimulation to result in spiking in accumbal neurons o donnell and grace 1995 moore and grace 1996 moreover moore and grace 1997 have found that the gating of prefrontal cortical input to accumbens neurons by temporal cortex is significantly reduced and pcp induced behaviors are augmented in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia prenatal exposure to the mitotoxin methylazoxymethanol acetate this modulation of frontal cortical afferents to the nucleus accumbens may have relevance for dopaminergic and pcp models of schizophrenia because dopamine receptor agonists and acute pcp administration both attenuate the temporal cortical gating of prefrontal inputs to the nucleus accumbens o donnell and grace 1996 moore and grace 1996 grace et al 1998 this effect of pcp is consistent with mesolimbic dopaminergic activation after acute administration however it is not known at present how chronic pcp treatment would affect this system we have demonstrated that hyper responsivity of the dopaminergic innervation of the nucleus accumbens is a consequence of long term pcp exposure jentsch et al 1998c thus at this level acute and chronic administration may induce somewhat similar effects summaryseveral neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates for altered behavior in pcp treated animals have been offered it is unclear comprehensively how the activation versus inhibition of dopamine systems induced by acute versus chronic exposure of pcp respectively will be incorporated into a final pathophysiological hypothesis of schizophrenia nevertheless it is important to note that pcp can not be argued to support a single transmitter hypothesis of schizophrenia it is perhaps more informative to investigate how individual behavioral alterations may be subserved by particular neurotransmitter dysfunctions pcp models of schizophrenia and antipsychotic drugsthe effects of neuroleptic drugs on pcp induced behavioral and biological effects in humans and animals have been examined with reports of varying results the modulation of the pcp induced alterations in dopamine transmission by putative antipsychotic drugs may also prove to be relevant for predicting cognitive response to therapeutic drugs response of pcp effects to antipsychotic drugsthe effects of antipsychotic drugs on the behavioral and neurobiological consequences of pcp administration in animals and humans have been studied in the hope that this model system would provide predictive information about the efficacy of novel antipsychotic drugs for use in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders several biological and behavioral indices predict differential clinical response to typical versus atypical antipsychotic drugs whereas others fail to produce similar results first it is important to reflect on the response of nmda receptor antagonist induced psychosis in humans to antipsychotic drugs several groups have reported moderate effects after administration of typical antipsychotic drugs to pcp abusing individuals with psychotic symptoms castellani et al 1982 giannini et al 1984 whereas other studies have failed to find such results rainey and crowder 1975 allen and young 1978 bowers et al 1990 recently several groups have examined neuroleptic effects on ketamine precipitated psychotic episodes in schizophrenic subjects lahti et al 1994 reported that haloperidol was ineffective at attenuating nmda antagonist induced symptoms whereas malhotra et al 1997b demonstrated that clozapine significantly blunted ketamine precipitated psychoses in view of the limited but positive data it is clear that further studies of the response of pcp psychosis to clozapine and other atypical antipsychotic drugs are warranted animal studies also seem to suggest that pcp induced behaviors are preferentially responsive to clozapine initial studies were directed at investigating the ability of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs to affect acute pcp induced hyperlocomotion social impairments and prepulse inhibition deficits in rats whereas haloperidol was found to be more effective at blocking amphetamine induced hyperlocomotion than clozapine the converse was true for pcp clozapine more effectively prevented pcp induced hyperlocomotion than haloperidol freed et al 1980 maurel remy et al 1995 furthermore clozapine has been reported to be more effective than haloperidol at restoring social behavior after pcp administration steinpreis et al 1994 sams dodd 1996 finally although haloperidol clearly failed to restore pcp induced sensorimotor gating deficits in rats swerdlow et al 1996 clozapine has been reported to prevent the same bakshi et al 1994 likewise novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine and seroquel were observed to present pcp induced prepulse inhibition deficits bakshi and geyer 1995 swerdlow et al 1996 both clozapine and haloperidol have been reported to prevent stress induced cognitive dysfunction in monkeys murphy et al 1996a an effect mediated by heightened prefrontal cortical dopamine transmission murphy et al 1996b finally we have reported that clozapine partially alleviated cognitive deficits in monkeys repeatedly treated with pcp jentsch et al 1997c in contrast we have observed that haloperidol actually exacerbates deficits in subchronic pcp treated monkeys jentsch et al 1998g these data as a group concur with findings in humans that clozapine is markedly more effective than haloperidol at alleviating ketamine induced behavioral deficits clozapine and haloperidol may exert differential or similar effects on pcp induced neurobiological changes depending upon the phenomenon being studied both clozapine and haloperidol as well as novel antipsychotic drugs prevent pcp induced neurotoxicity although clozapine has been reported to be more effective farber et al 1993 1996 in addition the facilitation of striatal neuron firing induced by pcp in awake behaving animals is reversed by either clozapine or haloperidol white et al 1995 finally clozapine but not haloperidol or raclopride has been reported to alleviate the pcp induced blockade of responses of pyramidal neurons in rat prefrontal cortex to exogenously applied nmda wang and liang 1998 it is informative to consider briefly the neurochemical effects of neuroleptic drugs in the context of pcp models of schizophrenia both haloperidol and clozapine block postsynaptic dopamine receptors at therapeutic doses haloperidol is a broad spectrum dopamine receptor antagonist affecting d2 like and to a lesser extent d1 like receptors clozapine shows slightly higher affinity for d4 receptors with smaller effects on d1 d3 and d2 subtypes seeman 1992 seeman and van tol 1994 arnt and skarsfeldt 1998 both clozapine and haloperidol given acutely increase extracellular levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and striatal complex acute clozapine treatment preferentially increased prefrontal dopamine release in the rat whereas haloperidol preferentially increased striatal dopamine efflux moghaddam and bunney 1990 pehek et al 1993 youngren et al 1994 and our group has recently observed a similar effect in the monkey youngren et al 1998 thus clozapine at doses that do not potently block d1 like receptors may actually potentiate transmission at this receptor subtype acute administration of atypical neuroleptics has also been observed to potentiate serotonin and noradrenergic transmission breier et al 1994 hertel et al 1997 alterations that may contribute to their beneficial effects the neurochemical consequences of clozapine and haloperidol administration may have relevance to their cognitive effects in monkeys repeatedly exposed to pcp we have argued for a relationship between dopaminergic hypofunction in prefrontal cortex and the cognitive deficits in pcp treated monkeys jentsch et al 1997c 1998e because clozapine may have a net dopamine d1 agonist effect in rats salmi and ahlenius 1996 the beneficial effects of clozapine in this paradigm may be mediated by a relative augmentation of cortical dopamine transmission on the other hand haloperidol largely blocks dopamine receptors and only mildly stimulates cortical dopamine release and this net reduction in dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortex may subserve its inability to reverse the pcp induced cognitive deficits likewise an augmentation of cortical dopamine transmission may be associated with the ability of clozapine to alleviate schizophrenic negative symptomatology kane et al 1988 which may result in part from cortical dopaminergic hypofunction davis et al 1991 knable and weinberger 1997 furthermore the conflicting findings regarding the cognitive effects of clozapine in schizophrenic patients may be caused by the use of high therapeutic doses of clozapine which ultimately occupy a significant percentage of dopamine d1 receptors the primary dopamine receptor subtype in prefrontal cortex lidow and goldman rakic 1994 rendering the increased synaptic dopamine without a postsynaptic target long term pcp exposure further implications for schizophreniastudies of the pathophysiology implicated by pcp models of schizophrenia especially in nonhuman primates may lend considerable understanding to problems related to dopaminergic and cognitive dysfunction in human subjects indeed consideration of the nature of dopaminergic perturbation in the pcp model of schizophrenia in particular should provide insights regarding novel treatments for symptom subtypes of this disorder although selective pharmacological modulation of a cortical hypofunction and subcortical hyperfunction may pose a significant challenge nevertheless information regarding 1 the selective pharmacological regulation of the heterogeneous ascending dopamine systems deutch and roth 1990 2 the distinct distribution of dopamine receptor subtypes in forebrain e g bergson et al 1995 mrzljak et al 1996 and 3 the functionally distinct properties of these receptor subtypes e g on cognition goldman rakic et al 1996 should aid in construction of new strategies application of knowledge regarding the unique sensitivity of the mesoprefrontal dopamine projection to stress and several neurotransmitter influences such as norepinephrine acetylcholine serotonin and substance p deutch and roth 1990 should allow for novel strategies for alleviating cortical dopaminergic hypoactivity for instance several recent studies have focused on the ability of nicotine which activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and increases d1 dopaminergic transmission nisell et al 1996 1997 to alleviate schizophrenic symptomatology goff et al 1992 adler et al 1993 ziedonis and george 1997 including deficits presumably mediated by cortical dysfunction olincy et al 1998 another receptor that seems selectively to regulate the mesocortical dopamine projection is the serotonin 5 ht2a receptor m100 907 a selective antagonist of this receptor preferentially increases prefrontal cortical dopamine release schmidt and fadayel 1995 and its clinical antipsychotic efficacy is currently being investigated furthermore clozapine has high affinity for this receptor meltzer 1995 ashby and wang 1996 arnt and skarsfeldt 1998 drugs such as these which augment cortical dopamine transmission may alleviate some components of frontal cortical associated deficits in the pcp model theoretically if cortical dopaminergic dysfunction propagates subcortical dopamine dysfunction both phenomenon could be alleviated after cortical dopaminergic augmentation however this is unlikely because striatal dopamine release is under the influence of other brain regions likely dysfunctional in schizophrenia e g the hippocampus lipska et al 1993 nevertheless the pcp model may provide a useful experimental paradigm for testing drugs that selectively affect cortical dopamine transmission likewise selective modulation of subcortical dopamine systems may be amenable to investigation in animals that have been repeatedly treated with pcp regulation of mesostriatal dopaminergic transmission at the cell body or terminal level may allow for such specific effects for example substance k receptors have been argued to affect subcortical dopamine systems more potently deutch and roth 1990 in addition dopamine d3 receptors are highly enriched in the ventral striatum diaz et al 1995 and may possess autoreceptor like functions aretha et al 1995 thus low doses of a dopamine d3 receptor agonist may preferentially educe mesostriatal dopamine overflow indeed tamminga and colleagues 1978 1986 lahti et al 1998 have shown that schizophrenic symptomatology is reduced after administration of low autoreceptor preferring doses of apomorphine or preclamol and have hypothesized that dopamine autoreceptor preferring agonists may be effective treatments for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia hypotheses such as these may be tested at the preclinical level in subjects that have undergone long term pcp treatment conclusionsthe hypoglutamatergic and hyperdopaminergic hypotheses of schizophrenia have been in principle difficult to reconcile we have argued that dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems beginning with nmda receptor antagonism is likely responsible for the behavioral pathologies exhibited by subjects acutely or repeatedly treated with pcp the reviews of javitt and zukin 1991 and o donnell and grace 1998 reflect this hypothesis as they argue for dysfunction within multiple interactive brain systems after pcp administration it seems plausible that the heterogeneous subsets of schizophrenic symptoms result from these multiple neural pathologies any hypotheses of schizophrenia based upon dysfunction within single transmitter systems must be considered limited instead an integrative multisystem hypothesis of schizophrenia is warranted and indeed is supported by this pharmacological model of the disorder further investigations of the pathophysiology of pcp treated subjects especially after long term exposure should provide unparalleled insights regarding the neurobiological basis of both normal and schizophrenic functioning and ultimately provide a context for the design of selective treatments for affected forebrain circuits pharmacological modulation of the complex neurochemical dysfunctions of schizophrenia pose the ultimate therapeutic challenge but the characterization of models of the disorder such as that induced by long term pcp administration may be a fundamental step toward solving this intriguing riddle ellison and switzer 1993 ellison 1994 jones marsden robbins 1990 tamminga gotta thaker alphs foster

informationpublication historypublication date 18 january 2006 online abstractfull textreferences buy article permissions and reprintswilliam h kutteh m d ph d recurrent pregnancy loss is a profound personal tragedy to couples seeking parenthood and a formidable clinical challenge to their physicians although spontaneous abortion occurs in approximately 15 to 20 of clinically diagnosed pregnancies of reproductive aged women recurrent pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 1 to 2 of this same population 1 great strides have been made in characterizing the incidence and diversity of this heterogeneous disorder and a definite cause of pregnancy loss can be established in approximately two thirds of couples after a thorough evaluation 2 a complete evaluation will include investigations into genetic endocrinologic anatomic immunologic microbiologic thrombophilic and iatrogenic causes table 1 the occurrence of recurrent pregnancy losses may induce significant emotional distress and in some cases intensive supportive care may be necessary successful outcomes will occur in more than two thirds of all couples 3 table 1 standard evaluation and management of recurrent

loss included those couples with three or more spontaneous consecutive pregnancy losses ectopic and molar pregnancies are not typically included it is not clear whether occult early miscarriages diagnosed by sensitive human chorionic gonadotrophin assays should be included in these definitions several studies recently have indicated that the risk of recurrent miscarriage after two successive losses is similar to the risk of miscarriage in women after three successive losses thus it is reasonable to start an evaluation after two or more consecutive spontaneous miscarriages to determine the etiology of the pregnancy loss especially when the woman is older than 35 years of age or when the couple has had difficulty conceiving 3 4 miscarriages are considered any loss before 20 gestational weeks some authors further divide these into embryonic losses which occur before the 9th gestational week and fetal losses which occur at or after the 9th gestational week to 20 weeks although there is no developmental phase to justify this distinction those couples with primary recurrent loss have never had a previous viable infant whereas those with secondary recurrent loss have delivered a pregnancy beyond 20 weeks previously and then suffered subsequent losses other investigators advocate the designation of tertiary recurrent loss to identify those women who have multiple miscarriages interspersed with normal pregnancies this issue of seminars in reproductive medicine includes reviews on the research methodology relevant to recurrent pregnancy loss entire chapters are dedicated to genetic anatomic endocrinologic immunologic and thrombophilic associations with recurrent loss the authors have devoted considerable effort to provide up to date information in each area and their efforts are greatly appreciated references1 kutteh w h recurrent pregnancy loss in precis an update in obstetrics and gynecology washington dc american college of obstetrics and gynecology 2002 151

version 1abstractobjective reported associations of oxidized low density lipoprotein oxldl with noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis are inconsistent in the asklepios study cohort of asymptomatic subjects aged 35 to 55 years we evaluated the relationship of circulating oxldl with subclinical atherosclerosis in the carotid and femoral arteries methods and results participants n 2524 51 5 females completed a study questionnaire and underwent a clinical examination blood analysis of oxldl mab 4e6 and other risk markers and ultrasound examination of intima media thickness imt and plaques in the left and right carotid and femoral arteries oxldl concentrations were highest in subjects with femoral plaques n 658 in the group of subjects with carotid plaques n 476 elevated oxldl concentrations are related to concomitant femoral plaques detected in 54 of these subjects multivariate regression analyses including anthropometric hemodynamic biochemical and lifestyle variables showed that femoral plaques are independently related to oxldl whereas femoral imt carotid imt or carotid plaques were not independently associated with oxldl conclusion circulating oxldl is independently associated with femoral plaque and not with carotid artery wall damage in the asklepios cohort of 2524 asymptomatic subjects 35 to 55 years we evaluated the relationship of circulating oxldl with carotid and femoral intima media thickness and plaques oxldl was highest in subjects with femoral atherosclerosis and in those with concomitant carotid and femoral lesions femoral plaques was the sole echographic variable independently related to oxldl oxidative stress plays an important role in atherogenesis 1 oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein ldl in the subendothelial space of the vessel wall is thought to be a key initiating step in atherosclerosis 2 oxidized ldl oxldl may not only contribute to foam cell generation but also stimulates the synthesis of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and induces inflammatory processes 1 2 in the last decade immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies against oxidation dependent epitopes of ldl which made it possible to directly measure oxldl in the circulation 3 4increased oxldl concentrations are found in patients with coronary artery disease cad and are related to the severity of cad 5 7 however results from clinical studies on ldl oxidation and cad are not consistent oxldl predicts future cad in healthy men8 but is not an independent predictor of cad after adjustment of lipid markers in men and women 9reports of an association of oxldl with noninvasive imaging of atherosclerosis have also yielded heterogeneous results several investigators found that oxldl concentrations correlate with carotid intima media thickness imt in the general population 10 11 in familial hyperlipidemia families 12 and in cad patients 13 some studies have reported that oxldl correlates with plaque occurrence in the carotid and femoral arteries 10 14 15 in general these ultrasound studies provide an incomplete anatomic picture because most investigators have focused on a single phenotype imt or plaque usually in a single vascular territory carotid femoral or segment in elderly or high risk populations limited data are available from younger populations where atherosclerosis is expected to be less generalized across multiple arterial sites because atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive process age is the most important risk determinant for structural changes of the arteries 16 17 the initiation speed of development and phenotypic expression of atherosclerotic lesions are mainly artery related 18 although lesions of the carotid and femoral arteries generally share common risk factors several of these risk factors have different impact in different arterial territories 19 20 some subjects with echographically documented carotid lesions might have concomitant femoral atherosclerosis while others have not 21 and vice versa the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of circulating oxldl concentration with imt and plaques measured in both carotid and femoral arterial sites in the large asklepios study cohort of asymptomatic subjects aged 35 to 55 years methodsthe asklepios study protocol methodology and baseline population characteristics have been published elsewhere 22study populationwe recruited a cohort of 2524 apparently healthy male and female volunteers age 35 to 55 years at study initiation in october 2002 the subjects were randomly sampled from the twinned belgian communities of erpe mere and nieuwerkerken and were free from overt cardiovascular disease exclusion criteria were 1 clinical presence of atherosclerotic or atherothrombotic disease 2 major concomitant illness 3 diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 if proven clinical macro vasculopathy or significant renal impairment 4 pregnancy 5 inability to provide informed consent the ethical committee of the ghent university hospital approved the study protocol participant examination questionnaireeach examination component was performed with a fixed order after 10 to 15 minutes of rest in a temperature controlled environment 1 informed consent and the study questionnaire were reviewed 2 basic clinical data were measured and 3 blood samples were taken by one study nurse followed by 4 the vascular ultrasound measurements by one cardiologist the questionnaire included information on smoking history including pack years weekly alcohol consumption fruit and vegetable intake physical activity and educational level 22 subjects smoking at least 1 cigarette or any nicotine per week were categorized as active smokers subjects who had stopped smoking at least 1 week and who had a cumulative exposure of at least 100 cigarettes were categorized as ex smokers fruit and vegetable intake was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire a daily fruit or vegetable intake of 400 g was classified as sufficient physical activity was categorized based on intensity metabolic equivalents met and on frequency averaged throughout the year subjects were defined as active when performing activities 5 met at least twice weekly body mass index bmi was calculated as weight kg height m 2 blood pressure bp was recorded using cuff patient matched bilateral triplicate measurements on a rested sitting subject using a validated oscillometric device vascular imagingsubjects underwent ultrasonographic examination of the left and right carotid and femoral arteries vivid 7 ge vingmed ultrasound 22 25 analysis of the ecg gated raw dicom cineloops was performed offline by a single blinded measurement dedicated reader carotid and femoral arteries were scanned bilaterally for the presence of plaque focal protrusion 50 compared to adjacent sites imt 1 5 mm imt was defined as the distance from the leading edge of the lumen intima interface to the leading edge of the media adventitia interface measured in end diastole at the far wall 1 to 2 cm before the bifurcations 22 25 intraobserver variability of imt was 5 24 failure to measure imt was associated with obesity or plaque with 8 168 and 198 missing values for the right carotid left femoral and right femoral arteries respectively the reported imt is the mean and maximum of the right and left segments when the measure was missing on one side the imt estimate was based on the measurement of the site for which a value was available in 41 cases both right and left femoral imt were missing bilateral plaque occurrence so that no imt value for the femoral artery was available because segments with an imt 1 5 mm were classified as plaque and because of the bilateral screening it was possible to classify all subjects carotid or femoral vascular target organ damage tod was defined as unilateral or bilateral imt 0 9 mm or presence of plaque biochemical analysesall subjects were

before its sudden and often fatal first manifestation therefore early detection and recognition of subclinical atherosclerosis has received increased attention in the last decades a plethora of noninvasive phenotypes are currently being used in research and some have found their way into clinical practice several of these vascular phenotypes have been reported to correlate with circulating oxldl concentration 10 15although the literature evidence linking oxldl to subclinical atherosclerosis seems robust it is also heterogeneous because of lack of uniformity in definitions measurement protocols choice of arterial site carotid versus femoral or phenotype imt plaque and health or risk of the study populations these studies have been performed mostly in elderly populations whereas less data are available in younger low risk populations using multiple phenotypes across multiple arterial sites such as we report here in the asklepios cohort we found that males and females with vascular tod defined as imt thickening or plaques detected either unilaterally or bilaterally in the carotid and femoral arteries show elevated oxldl concentrations compared to subjects with undetectable tod however highest oxldl concentrations were observed in subjects with femoral tod femoral plaque was the sole echographic variable that was independently associated with oxldl serum ldl cholesterol and oxldl were independently of each other related to femoral plaque in the total group of subjects with carotid plaques we found that elevated oxldl concentrations were associated with concomitant femoral plaques detected in approximately 55 of these subjects this might explain the discrepancy between our findings and those of other investigators with regard to the carotid echographic measures 11 13 previously reported associations of oxldl with carotid atherosclerosis might thus have been confounded by the presence of concomitant femoral plaques in the populations studied in the air study elevated oxldl concentrations were associated with femoral plaques but not with carotid plaques and were not independently related to imt in 58 year old men 10 associations between risk factors and atherosclerosis can have territorial specificity carotid coronary femoral 18 20 taken together with a substantial but incomplete overlap in atherosclerosis prevalence between different arterial territories this territorial specificity can be the basis of spurious associations in studies only studying a single vascular territory the age range of the asklepios cohort 35 to 55 years represents a transitional period many study participants show an anatomically fragmented atherosclerosis restricted to focalized lesions and characterized by a heterogeneously distributed phenotype these subjects have either imt thickening or plaque or either carotid disease or femoral disease we therefore assume that correlations with oxldl should be better in older populations characterized by more generalized atherosclerotic disease the strong association between oxldl and femoral plaques might have several explanations oxldl can be detected in human atherosclerotic plaques 5 7 recently circulating oxldl has been associated with coronary calcification deposits and with fibro calcific remodeling 11 28 one could hypothesize that some oxldl will diffuse back from atheroma into the bloodstream in which it can be measured 7 10 thus leakage of oxldl from atheroma in subjects with high total plaque burden associated with femoral plaques 29 might have a significant impact on total circulating oxldl furthermore it is known that femoral arterial disease is strongly associated with conditions particularly smoking characterized by high oxidative stress 30 oxldl concentrations negatively correlate with ldl particle size 13 31 small dense ldl particles are more susceptible to oxidation and more easily penetrate into the subendothelial space based on vascular ultrasound data analysis with respect to ldl size 32 33 it has been suggested that the femoral artery is more vulnerable than the carotid artery to the oxidative charge on small dense ldl in contrast hypertension is the major factor contributing to carotid vascular damage and leading to complications such as stroke 18 19the lack of independent association between oxldl and femoral and also carotid imt could be explained by the fact that imt contrary to plaque is not only a surrogate of atherosclerosis and also reflects adaptation to other factors such as hypertension normalization of wall stress 34a limitation of this study and most other current population studies is that subclinical coronary atherosclerosis was not assessed it has been reported that persons with femoral plaque have a higher probability of coronary atherosclerosis 29 35 thus higher oxldl concentrations in persons with femoral plaque may also reflect more extensive coronary atherosclerosis we conclude that femoral plaque but not carotid atherosclerosis is independently associated with elevated circulating oxldl in a general population aged 55 years our data suggest that associations of oxldl with carotid atherosclerosis are potentially confounded by the presence of concomitant underlying atherosclerosis in other arterial territories original received january 21 2008 final version accepted may 15 2008

including aids and sars here we discuss the principal mechanisms of rna virus evolution and highlight areas where future research is required the rapidity of sequence change in rna viruses means that they are useful experimental models for the study of evolution in general and it enables us to watch them change in real time and retrace the spread through populations with molecular phylogenies an understanding of the mechanisms of rna virus sequence change is also crucial to predicting important aspects of their emergence and long term evolution download pdfmainrna viruses have become an important area of study for epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists alike1 2 3 much of this research is centred on two main themes understanding the mechanisms of rna virus evolution often through experimental analyses and reconstruction of the epidemiological history of a given virus namely its origin and spread through populations and the forces that promote its emergence here we review the progress and current state of both these research topics mechanisms of viral evolutionprocesses of evolutionary change central to population genetics is understanding how the five main forces of evolutionary change mutation recombination natural selection genetic drift and migration interact to shape the genetic structure of populations these same forces are also central to understanding rna virus evolution although their relative strengths differ to those observed for dna based organisms for rna viruses most attention has been directed towards mutation selection and genetic drift we can understand their importance and interaction by considering four basic properties of rna virus populations first rna viruses often have very large population sizes such that the number of viral particles in a given organism might be as high as 1012 second such immense population sizes which are several orders of magnitude larger than those observed for cellular organisms are a product of explosive replication for example a single infectious particle can produce an average of 100 000 viral copies in 10 hours as natural selection is most efficient with large populations it is no surprise that experiments using rna viruses have shown that selection is of fundamental importance in controlling their evolutionary dynamics such that new mutants with increased fitness as measured by their selection coefficient s continually appear and out compete older inferior alleles4 third owing to the lack of proofreading activity in their polymerase proteins rna viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates of any group of organisms approximately one mutation per genome per replication5 6 finally the genome sizes of rna viruses are typically small ranging from only 3 kb to 30 kb with a median size of 9 kb these last two properties are intimately related because high mutation rates are theoretically expected to limit genome size in particular a mutation rate that exceeds a notional error threshold set at approximately the reciprocal of the genome size generates so many deleterious mutations in each replication cycle that even the fittest viral genomes are unable to reproduce and population size decreases to extinction7 8 however rna viruses that exist close to but below the error threshold are also able to produce many beneficial mutations in a short time thereby enhancing adaptability provided that their populations are sufficiently large in the simple situation outlined above rna viruses should evolve in a highly deterministic manner with the process of natural selection working efficiently on a vast array of mutational variants although it is true that rna virus populations are often highly diverse this is not sufficient to explain the entirety of rna virus evolution in particular deterministic approaches assume that population sizes are universally large such that the fate of a given mutation can be predicted if its frequency and fitness are known although the population sizes of rna viruses are often very large factors such as variation in replication potential among variants differences in generation time among infected cells and population bottlenecks most notably during transmission between hosts might lead to an effective population size denoted ne that is much smaller than the actual number of infected cells theory predicts that in populations where ne is small such that the compound parameter nes 1 genetic drift has an important role in determining the frequency and fate of mutations9 recombination might also have an important role in rna virus evolution although most studies indicate that recombination rates in many rna viruses are often lower than those in other organisms10 there are notable exceptions perhaps the most dramatic is hiv in which the genomic recombination rate exceeds the genomic mutation rate11 frequent recombination seems advantageous because it can create high fitness genotypes more rapidly than by mutation alone moreover recombination might also purge deleterious mutations from virus populations thereby preventing a dramatic decrease in fitness see below however simulation studies have indicated that frequent recombination is more likely to reduce fitness when mutation rates are close to the error threshold12 finally recombination rates in rna viruses might not be set by natural selection at all rather they could simply be a passive function of the replication machinery or ecological circumstances of the virus in question for example recombination rates seem to be particularly low in negative sense rna viruses13 which might be a result of the rna packaging mechanism understanding the causes of variation in recombination rate among rna viruses is a key area for future study a final factor to consider in rna virus evolution is migration migration also referred to as gene flow must not only be understood at a macroscopic level that is among hosts within a population among populations or between host species but also within a single infected individual from the site of inoculation viruses can be transported to several tissues generating intra host spatial variation14 however the effect of a non uniform population distribution on the spread fitness and variability of virus populations has been much less studied than other evolutionary factors although in some experiments a positive correlation between migration rate and the average fitness of the population has been observed15 the quasispecies as a model of rna virus evolution the remarkable mutational power of rna viruses has meant that their evolution has often been considered to be different to dna based organisms1 key to this is the concept of the quasispecies which was first developed by eigen and schuster16 to understand the dynamics of primitive evolutionary systems rna viruses are of particular importance in this respect as they might represent biological entities that evolve according to the rules of quasispecies theory the basis of quasispecies theory is the notion that the target of natural selection is not simply the fastest growing replicator but rather a broad spectrum of mutants that are produced by erroneous copying of the fittest or master sequence16 17 natural selection acts on the entire quasispecies because mutation rates close to the error threshold mean that individual viral genomes are linked by a mutational coupling all the possible mutational links between viral genomes are established so that the whole population evolves as a single unit one particularly important implication of this special form of group selection is that the fastest replicating rna viral genomes could be out competed by those with lower replication rates if the latter have a high probability of being generated by mutation from closely related variants an important question is whether the quasispecies model is an accurate description of rna virus evolution experimental evidence for the quasispecies was first reported for the bacteriophage q 18 subsequent experiments with mammalian vesicular stomatitis virus vsv provided one of the most important supporting observations for the quasispecies a high fitness viral variant was suppressed by one of lower fitness19 however this can also be explained by genetic drift the probability that any variant achieves fixation in a population is partially dependent on its initial frequency so most rare albeit advantageous variants are lost by drift in small populations indeed a generic problem of quasispecies theory is that genetic drift is expected to be extremely restricted17 which might not be the case for viruses in nature20 21 more recently in vitro studies of the evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage 6 provided evidence for one aspect of quasispecies theory that viral genomes differ in their mutational spectra and that this affects fitness22 however because these experiments used small populations and rugged fitness landscapes and because little is known about fitness landscapes in nature the generality of these results in uncertain although the quasispecies has a firm theoretical foundation and there is some evidence for it in laboratory populations whether it applies to rna viruses in nature is less clear for example simple observations of high levels of genetic variation in rna viruses are not sufficient to prove the existence of quasispecies although this is often the only evidence presented nor is the existence of an error threshold which can easily be explained using evolutionary models8 rather to demonstrate that rna viruses form quasispecies it is necessary to show that natural selection acts on viral populations as a unit testing this prediction in nature will be one of the most important future areas of study for those investigating the mechanics of viral evolution experimental evolution of rna virusesexperimental evolution constitutes a powerful tool for simulating natural evolution23 and is frequently used to test the basic principles of evolutionary theory24 box 1 provides a schematic overview of experiments of this type the strength of the experimental approach is that the phenotypic and molecular changes of rna viral populations can be monitored in real time more importantly under an appropriate experimental setting it is also possible to directly estimate changes in fitness one of the main goals of modern population genetics a panoply of experiments have highlighted both the mechanisms of rna virus evolution and what rna viruses can tell us about evolution in general what have experiments told us about viral evolution experimental studies have made a substantial contribution towards understanding the processes that govern rna virus evolution25 the main findings of these experiments can be grouped into three general types first the molecular basis of adaptive evolution in viruses including the occurrence and frequency of convergent evolution26 27 viral attenuation28 and compensatory mutations29 second the role of population bottlenecks and the accumulation of deleterious mutations and how they affect fitness30 31 32 33 finally the importance of clonal interference34 and complementation35 in determining rates of viral adaptation in brief these studies make eight conclusions36 first there is extensive convergent and parallel evolution both in genotype and in phenotype across lineages replicating in the same host perhaps reflecting the fact that relatively few sites are free to vary when genome sizes are small second advantageous mutations that are fixed early on when viruses are challenged with new environments confer the largest fitness benefit third phenotypic evolution tends to mirror the evolution of fitness increments with large changes occurring early in new environments fourth rates of nucleotide substitution remain approximately constant through time fifth overall genetic diversity remains low during the phase of maximum fitness increase and rises once fitness becomes asymptotic sixth evolutionary changes that increase fitness in one host often although not always reduce fitness in an alternative host seventh population bottlenecks and spatial heterogeneity lead to an increase in unique nucleotide substitutions finally severe reductions in population size can lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and consequent fitness losses what have experiments told as about evolution in general many fundamental questions in evolutionary biology have been addressed using rna viruses as model experimental systems one of the first questions addressed concerned a severe consequence of deleterious mutation accumulation known as muller s ratchet37 studies have explored how clonally evolving rna viruses prevent the excessive build up of deleterious mutations in populations that are experiencing strong bottlenecks or small effective sizes38 one popular suggestion is that sexual reproduction has evolved in rna viruses because it allows them to escape muller s ratchet when effective population sizes are small39 40 41 in this model the accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to be less of a problem for rna viruses that either recombine or undergo reassortment in the case of viruses with segmented genomes however recombination rates are often so low in rna viruses that it is difficult to hypothesize that they have a direct fitness benefit in the face of low recombination rates rna viruses could escape muller s ratchet because their long term effective population sizes might not be small enough to allow deleterious mutations to accumulate or perhaps compensatory mutations are sufficiently frequent to counteract fitness losses42 experimental evolution with rna viruses has also been crucial for studying the dynamics of natural selection this has been the case for instance in studies of competitive exclusion43 the red queen hypothesis43 convergent evolution26 27 44 and the rhythm of adaptive change45 we expect rna viruses to continue to have an important role in this area for many years to come finally one promising area involves using rna viruses to test theories for the evolution of cooperation for example turner and chao conducted a series of experiments with bacteriophage 6 in which they demonstrated that rna viruses could evolve under prisoner s dilemma conditions46 and also escape from it47 despite the power of experiments there are still difficulties in estimating some of the important parameters in evolutionary biology such as the rate of deleterious mutation and fitness values in recent years a number of in silico approaches have been used to answer these questions most notably with computer generated genomes digital organisms that are designed to behave as living systems digital organisms have the ability to create a copy of their own genome but are subject to copying errors so that populations of programs evolve in and adapt to their environments48 although digital organisms are not as sophisticated as viruses they are useful study tools because experiments can be easily controlled and repeated digital organisms have been useful in studying predicted adaptive evolution over short and long timescales49 50 the role of epistasis in evolution51 and testing key aspects of quasispecies theory particularly whether fast replicators can be less fit than slower replicators at high mutation rates52 molecular epidemiology of rna virusesmolecular epidemiology was first introduced to the study of infectious disease in the early 1970s53 since this time the analysis of gene sequence variation has become a standard practice for virologists with an interest in epidemiology especially with the advent of new high throughput sequencing technologies from the typing of viral populations to the study of the origins of a new virus viral gene sequence variation has been used to answer a wide variety of questions increasing both the quantity and quality of the epidemiological data available in this section we discuss how particular aspects of rna virus evolution affect the reconstruction of their epidemiological history in this context it is important to note that the observed epidemiological patterns of viruses result from their evolution at two different levels within individual hosts54 and vectors55 and among hosts at the population level rna viruses differ greatly in their patterns and processes of intra and inter host evolution as well as in the duration of the infection caused and the type of immune response that is induced such factors must be considered when discussing their epidemiological dynamics in a comparative setting3 inferring epidemiological history many aspects of the epidemiological history of viruses can be graphically summarized in a phylogenetic tree the timescale of these trees can vary from a few weeks to many centuries and depends on the rate of accumulation of variation in the sequences under study and the timescale of sampling although graphically very similar there are important differences between phylogenetic trees and gene genealogies56 the former are used to analyse the evolutionary history of distinct viral species or genes usually by sampling one representative of each unit under study by contrast genealogies depict the history of genetic polymorphisms segregating in contemporaneous populations gene genealogies have been used extensively in the study of rna viruses because their rapid evolution means that sequence variation increases over very short periods of time indeed rna viruses constitute the most important class of measurably evolving populations57 with evolution even occurring during the infection of a single individual58 more accurate methods of evolutionary inference have already been designed for these rapidly evolving populations59 60 61 in particular whereas phylogenetic trees generally depict strictly bifurcating patterns of relationships gene genealogies can take into account recombination which will lead to inter connected networks of lineages moreover using a statistical approach called coalescent theory62 63 64 it is possible to infer demographic processes from genetic polymorphism data most notably rates of viral population growth and decline coalescent methods can operate under several population genetic models and use gene genealogies as key analytical tools coalescent theory therefore provides a crucial conceptual link between phylogenetics and population genetics both phylogenies and gene genealogies are relevant for the epidemiological analysis of rna viruses and are useful for investigating the origin of new viruses65 66 67 or identifying the source of an outbreak68 69 70 71 used in conjunction with population genetic theory they are also essential for the identification of positive72 73 or purifying74 natural selection at nucleotide sites the presence and extent of recombination13 75 76 and for dating important points in the history of epidemics67 77 78 genealogical analysis is especially relevant for reconstructing the recent epidemiological history of viral populations66 79 80 81 such as in forensic studies box 2 fig 1 and therefore have important implications for determining public health policies figure 1 two alternative epidemiological scenarios translate into different phylogenetic tree topologies the statistical support for which can be compared directly the tree in panel a depicts a common and close origin for samples 1 3 node a which is separate from the control samples 4 7 node b node a might correspond to a single outbreak or a suspected transmission among these patients whereas node b includes samples suspected but not related to the outbreak 4 7 and unrelated population controls 8 9 panel b represents the alternative proposal for sample 1 which is now separated from the former cluster and instead groups with the control samples similar proposals can be separately formulated for each of the samples 1 3 full size imagerates of evolutionary change in rna viruses although it is fair to assume that frequent mutation means that long term rates of nucleotide substitution are usually high in rna viruses in reality these rates might vary widely both within and among genes in the same species and among viral species82 indeed present data indicate that viral substitution rates are much more variable than their underlying mutation rates5 6 which is most likely a reflection of important differences in replication dynamics for example the nucleotide substitution rate in human t lymphotropic virus type ii htlv ii varies from 1 10 4 substitutions per site per year in epidemics with high rates of transmission and where replication is rapid such as those in injecting drug users to 1 10 7 substitutions per site per year in endemic situations where viruses are maintained within hosts through the clonal expansion of infected cells rather than by active replication83 however in many rna viruses substitution rates of 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 substitutions per site per year are observed82 the variation in substitution rates across viral genomes has benefits because it allows different epidemiological questions to be addressed relating to different temporal scales so rapidly evolving hypervariable gene regions are informative for studying viral evolution within individuals or for identifying the source of a particular disease outbreak more conserved regions are better suited for in depth phylogenetic inference from analysing viral genotypes at the species to family levels in a number of cases it has been proposed that molecular evolution within specific rna virus genes proceeds at a constant rate such molecular clocks have been proposed for human influenza a virus84 although the constancy of the evolutionary rate does not hold in many other cases82 85 86 87 non clocklike evolution can result from a number of evolutionary forces such as changes in host species changes in structural and functional constraints88 89 and the occurrence of positive selection although most modern methods of phylogenetic analysis incorporate such rate variation so that it is unlikely to cause significant error in the reconstruction of tree topologies it can have an important impact on the analysis of divergence times the emergence of rna virusesthe past 25 years have seen the emergence of several rna viruses which are either new to medical science or have increased in prevalence to the extent that they are now a major concern for public health agents that fall into this category include hiv hepatitis c virus and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov given the continuing threat that is posed by viral diseases it is essential that we determine the factors underlying viral emergence the evolutionary genetics of viral emergence hosts acquire rna viruses by two different mechanisms first owing to host virus co speciation host populations might have carried a specific rna virus for their entire evolutionary history although co speciation has been proposed in some rna viruses90 the process seems to be rare this is most likely a result of the short infectious periods of many rna viruses so that they have limited opportunity for the sustained transmission that is probably needed for co speciation by contrast many dna viruses establish persistent infections and are therefore expected to be able to follow long term patterns of host speciation91 a more common method by which rna viruses could enter new host species is through lateral transfer from different reservoir species both ecology and genetics seem to be important in determining whether a virus is able to successfully cross species boundaries in many cases ecological factors are the most important although such factors are diverse and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere92 93 they usually reflect changes in either the proximity or density of the host and or reservoir species which increase the likelihood that humans are exposed to new pathogens and that sustained transmission networks will be established far less is known about the possible genetic factors that might affect the ability of viruses to cross species boundaries although rna viruses are the group of pathogens that seem most able to cross species boundaries94 perhaps because high mutation rates provide them with an increased capacity to adapt to new hosts95 not all rna viruses are equally equipped in this respect for example in many cases rna viruses such as rabies virus infection in humans establish dead end infections in specific hosts without subsequent transmission which reflects imperfect adaptation this indicates that there are constraints that inhibit viral adaptation to new hosts perhaps owing to the fitness trade offs that seem commonplace in viruses that need to infect different hosts or cell types25 96 therefore infecting different hosts is likely to represent a major adaptive challenge for rna viruses despite their mutation rate examples are animal vector borne viruses which are less subject to adaptive evolution than their non vector borne counterparts presumably owing to the difficulties that are associated with simultaneous replication in hosts as divergent as invertebrates and vertebrates97 if extended over longer periods of time this will lead to a phylogenetic rule of cross species transmission such that the greater the evolutionary distance between hosts the lower the probability of viral transfer among them98 a fundamental aspect of the mechanistic basis of viral emergence is the relationship between virus and host cell receptors99 unless a virus has sequences that are able to recognize the cellular receptors of a potential host species successful cross species transmission will not be possible therefore jumping species boundaries might only be a problem for an rna virus if it has to adapt to different cellular receptors although this still does not guarantee that sustained transmission will be established in the new host an informative example is provided by influenza a virus birds are the main species reservoir and avian influenza a viruses are usually unable to jump directly into humans because they lack the necessary mutations in the haemagglutinin ha gene to infect human cells100 even when avian influenza a viruses do infect humans human to human transmission might not be established more generally the relationship between the virus and the host cell receptor predicts an association between the number of cells a virus infects and its host range thereby explaining whether a virus is a host specialist or generalist determining whether such a relationship exists should be a key goal in understanding the genetic basis of viral emergence case studies in viral emergence the complex interplay between ecology and genetics in viral emergence can be seen in hiv an important ecological factor in hiv emergence involves the bushmeat trade in west africa not only have a wide range of related simian immunodeficiency viruses sivs been isolated from animal carcasses101 but the bushmeat trade has increased owing to encroachment by humans on the ranges occupied by non human primates the siv that is found in chimpanzees sivcpz is the closest relative and therefore the most likely ancestor of human hiv 1 ref 102 whereas sivsm from sooty mangabeys seems to be the reservoir population for hiv 2 ref 103 for both hiv 1 and hiv 2 there have been multiple transfers of virus from their reservoirs into humans with these viruses most likely establishing themselves in humans during the last century67 77 also of importance was the movement of individuals infected early in the epidemic from small isolated rural populations to cities in africa103 which enabled incipient epidemic strains to reach a large number of susceptible hosts yet genetics is also likely to have been important in the emergence of hiv in particular phylogenetic studies indicate that sivs are most easily transmissable among related primate hosts104 implying that not all possible instances of cross species viral transmission that could occur do occur and that adaptive constraints might exist a more recent and highly publicized example of viral emergence is provided by the sars cov the agent of a severe form of pneumonia that has killed more than 700 people worldwide since its appearance in china in november 2002 it is unclear whether the epidemic of 2002 2003 was the first appearance of sars or whether the virus had sporadically entered human populations previously but without detrimental consequences the animal reservoir for sars cov is also a subject for debate phylogenetic analysis reveals that sars cov is equidistant between coronavirus groups 1 and 2 which are usually isolated from mammalian species and coronavirus group 3 which is currently confined to birds65 105 106 fig 2 moreover the sequence divergence between these three groups and sars cov is so large that sars cov has clearly experienced a long period of independent evolution studies of animals sold at chinese markets have detected antibodies in a number of mammalian species107 most notably viruses obtained from the himalayan palm civet a member of the viverridae are closely related to human strains of sars cov whether this species represents the main reservoir for sars cov is still unclear finally there have also been suggestions that sars cov is a recombinant of mammalian and avian coronaviruses and that this genetic event might have trigged viral emergence108 however because the sequences involved are so divergent the phylogenetic incongruence in trees of sars cov seems more likely to be due to variation in the molecular clock than inter coronavirus recombination figure 2 the phylogenetic relationships of sars coronavirus sars cov inferred using sequences of the spike glycoprotein a phylogenetic relationship of sars cov to the known coronaviruses owing to the highly divergent nature of these viruses the analysis was conducted using an alignment of 12 amino acid sequences that are 1 270 residues in length the tree was inferred

viral emergence the holy grail for studies of emerging diseases is to predict which infectious agents are likely to infect human populations in the future although we are a long way from making accurate predictions evolutionary genetics does allow some basic rules to be established and phylogenetic methods have been used to successfully predict the future population survival of strains of influenza a virus109 first the larger the population size of the reservoir species the more viruses it can harbour including those with shorter durations of infection and increased virulence110 consequently animal species that live at high densities such as some bats rodents and birds are most likely to be reservoirs particularly those animal populations that already live in close proximity to humans less intuitively if there is a relationship between the breadth of cell tropism and the number of species infected most attention should be given to those viruses that infect several cell types more importantly a comprehensive survey of rna virus diversity should be undertaken in appropriate animal species this can be done through the use of degenerate pcr primers that have been designed for several rna virus families followed by studies to determine whether the viruses will grow in human cells similar approaches have already uncovered a plethora of new virus families from marine environments111 rna virus evolution in the long termone aim of studies of rna virus evolution is to use our understanding of evolutionary processes in the short term which have often been acquired from experiments to predict what evolution will do in the long term although evolutionary biologists are rightly nervous about predicting future change the rapid pace of rna virus evolution means that these predictions can be tested quickly of most immediate interest are patterns of drug resistance and viral virulence the evolution of drug resistance understanding drug resistance is one area in which population biology has a direct impact on public health112 113 in the case of rna viruses most interest has focused on the potential of drugs to control hiv infection despite the optimism that initially surrounded the deployment of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart which involves combinations of drugs114 antiviral therapy is unlikely to provide a cure for hiv there are several reasons for this not least of which is that despite our inability to detect viruses in some patients receiving haart viral replication is ongoing although at greatly reduced levels115 early studies predicting the length of time it would take for resistance to arise under multiple drug therapy also underestimated the importance of recombination in hiv which we now know is extensive116 frequent recombination could allow drug resistance to be acquired more rapidly than acquisition through mutation alone there are many factors that influence the evolution of drug resistance and important results have been obtained for example regarding the probability of resistance mutations arising before and during treatment and the optimal time for the onset of drug treatment117 one important question which also relates to the mechanics of viral evolution in general is whether drug resistance mutations have a fitness cost compared with wild type alleles in the absence of the drug if there is a fitness cost we would hypothesize that resistance mutations would not reach high frequencies in populations despite their benefit to the virus in hosts there is evidence that in the absence of the drug hiv strains harbouring drug resistant mutations are less fit than wild type hiv strains118 unfortunately in other cases drug resistant hiv mutants seem to have greater infectivity and even replication capacity than wild type viruses119 not surprisingly these mutations are increasingly sampled from drug naive patients120 even if drug mutations are universally advantageous their long term success depends on more than their individual fitness an important mediating factor is the strength of genetic drift at the population level if drift is strong which will be the case if effective population sizes are small the frequencies that mutations eventually attain in populations has a large stochastic component for rna viruses effective population size reflects the mode of transmission this can be shown by comparing hiv with influenza a virus3 in the case of the respiratory transmitted influenza a virus the host population is large and extensively mixed consequently advantageous mutations most notably those that confer antigenic escape are able to be fixed in the virus population in a regular manner121 by contrast population level selection seems to be considerably weaker in the sexually transmitted hiv although some evidence for long term cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl mediated selection has been found122 this contrasts with intra host hiv evolution in which immune driven natural selection is the dominant evolutionary process72 123 124 the reduced impact of selection at the population level is most likely to be caused by extensive variation in rates of partner exchange which in turn reduces the effective population size125 and because there is a large bottleneck at transmission126 therefore for hiv intra host and inter host evolution seem to be largely decoupled although fewer studies have compared intra and inter host evolution in acute rna virus infections a recent analysis of dengue virus indicated that most amino acid changes that arise within hosts are deleterious in the long term74 the evolution of viral virulence the evolution of virulence has long been of interest to population biologists a common view is that if virulence is a selected trait at all then it is often involved in a trade off with transmissibility the balance of these factors that maximizes the basic reproductive rate r0 of the pathogen is favoured by natural selection127 although this has recently been questioned128 for rna viruses it is therefore important to determine whether virulence is optimized and if so how it is linked to transmissibility complexities arise because virulence is also likely to vary according to the transmission mode129 and whether there is a long period of intra host evolution including superinfection by other strains which increases intra strain competition and therefore virulence130 in short predictions about the long term evolution of virulence in rna viruses need to be made on a case specific basis however some aspects of the evolution of virulence reflect those that are associated with drug resistance for example if particular mutations confer virulence then whether they become fixed in populations also depends on the strength of genetic drift even if they are advantageous consequently the optimal level of virulence might not be acquired by chance in small populations similarly if the evolutionary process differs greatly within and among hosts a selectively favoured level of virulence within hosts might be disadvantageous among hosts the intra host evolution of hiv tends to result in the production of high virulence viral strains that preferentially use the cxcr4 chemokine receptor infect cells faster and cause aids to develop more rapidly131 however these strains seem to be transmitted less often indicating that they are selectively disadvantageous in new hosts132 understanding the interplay between virulence and transmissibility is clearly central to understanding the evolution of virulence of rna virus in diseases conclusionsestablishing the rules of rna virus evolution is important not only will this provide information that is essential for understanding the basic mechanisms of evolutionary change but it will assist in the design of strategies for the control treatment and eradication of rna viruses and perhaps for predicting their emergence although it is clear that rna viruses are unique in the rapidity with which they mutate their evolution cannot be described in full without a consideration of all the processes of evolutionary change a particular challenge for the future is to determine whether viral evolution in nature is similar to that established in vitro the beauty of rna viruses is that the link between experimental and natural systems can be made simply few other organisms are as well suited for studying evolutionary processes box 1 experiments in rna virus evolutionat the start of an experiment see figure panel a n flasks containing a cell monolayer are infected with the original mutant resistant to the wild type wt inhibitor population subsequently a sample is transferred between flasks until the end of the experiment when evolved mutants are collected the final samples can then be analysed in two different ways fitness assaysthis technique shown in panel b of the figure requires a mixture of the evolved mutant and the ancestral wt which is then used to infect cell monolayers in a flask and two additional dishes with and without the wt inhibitor respectively on the following day a sample is taken from the first flask to infect cell monolayers in a new flask and two new dishes under the same conditions as used previously the sample from the second flask is then used to infect two new dishes with and without the wt inhibitor plaque numbers are counted as a measure of virus particle numbers calculating the logarithm of the mutant wt quotient against time gives the relative fitness of the evolved mutant growth curvesthis procedure shown in panel c of the figure requires the infection of the evolved mutants into cell monolayers in separate flasks taking several samples from each flask at different times and using the ancestral wt clone as a control plaque numbers are counted in the plate assay to measure viral growth calculation of the logarithm of the viral titre against time t shows the growth rate for the evolved mutant populations show morefrom this boxbox 2 molecular epidemiology and forensicsestablishing the source of a viral outbreak is one of the many applications of molecular epidemiology occasionally this work has implications other than epidemiological for instance ou et al 68 were able to identify an hiv infected dentist as the inadvertent donor of the virus to some of his patients and to simultaneously discard him as the source of viruses infecting others more recently a similar analysis identified a medical doctor as the source of hiv infection in a former lover133 this is the first case in which a molecular epidemiological analysis has been accepted as evidence in a criminal court in the united states owing to the rapid rate of rna virus evolution they can be useful in forensic medicine given a rigorous statistical framework for this it is necessary to translate the proposals of both the defendant and the prosecutor into testable phylogenetic hypotheses gonz lez candelas et al 134 used this approach to evaluate the individual likelihoods of a number of hepatitis c virus patients having been infected in a hospital from a common source in this case the prosecutor s hypothesis was that each patient was infected at the hospital conversely the defendant s hypothesis was that each patient became separately infected from the general population these two proposals translate into different phylogenetic tree topologies the likelihoods of which can be compared directly the prosecutor s proposal is equivalent to observing a monophyletic group comprising the infected patients which is significantly distinct from the background population whereas the defendant s proposal corresponds to the grouping of the sequences from each infected patient with those of the background population this molecular analysis proved that all the individuals were from a single outbreak and was the first report of the use of molecular phylogenies to determine the likelihood of a patient sharing the source of infection with other infected patients show morefrom this boxaccession codesaccessionsgenbank embl

We used the Cre-lox system to delete beta1-integrin in all lens cells as the lens vesicle transitions into the lens. Adult mice lacking beta1-integrin in the lens are microphthalmic due to apoptosis of the lens epithelium and neonatal disintegration of the lens fibers. The first morphological alterations in beta1-integrin null lenses are seen at 16.5 dpc when the epithelium becomes disorganized and begins to upregulate the fiber cell markers beta- and gamma-crystallins, the transcription factors cMaf and Prox1 and downregulate Pax6 levels demonstrating that beta1-integrin is essential to maintain the lens epithelial phenotype. Furthermore, beta1-integrin null lens epithelial cells upregulate the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and nuclear Smad4 and downregulate Smad6 suggesting that beta1-integrin may brake TGFbeta family signaling leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in the lens. In contrast, beta1-integrin null lens epithelial cells show increased E-cadherin immunoreactivity which supports the proposed role of beta1-integrins in mediating complete EMT in response to TGFbeta family members. Thus, beta1-integrin is required to maintain the lens epithelial phenotype and block inappropriate activation of some aspects of the lens fiber cell differentiation program.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

justify lumbar fusion or stabilization a quantitative assessment and definition of spinal instability are essential to quantify spinal instability the tensile stiffness of a motion segment vertebra disc vertebra was measured with a spinal distractor during spinal decompression surgery stiffness was indicated by the relationship between load and displacement between the two adjacent spinous processes where a vertebral spreader was suspended a load displacement curve was recorded at each step of surgical decompression and fixation while the motion segment was being distracted at a constant speed the device used for measuring stiffness of a spinal motion segment is a lumbar spinal spreader with a load strain gauge and a displacement transducer the stiffness of a spinal motion segment was reduced as disc degeneration developed degenerative spondylolisthetic discs showed the least stiffness lowest 3 9 n mm average 5 4 n mm the stiffness of herniated discs however was relatively greater average 11 8 n mm the stiffness of normal motion segments was greater than affected segments if the stiffness of a motion segment before decompression was graded as 100 it was reduced to 82 after partial laminectomy and facetectomy and to 65 after discectomy on average after interbody fusion by iliac bone graft it increased to 133 and to 184 after luque fixation lippincott

collected from the grounds of the phujong nayoa national park ubon ratchathani province thailand as a result of a polyphasic taxonomy study this strain was identified as a member of the genus micromonospora this strain was a gram stain positive aerobic actinobacterium with well developed substrate mycelium with hyphae forming a single microspore was non motile stran tms7t was identified according to its 16s rrna gene sequence as a new member of the genus micromonospora the closest phylogenetic members sharing a similarity were micromonospora chersina dsm 44151t at 99 4 and micromonospora rosaria dsm 803t micromonospora tulbaghiae tvu1t micromonospora inositola dsm 43819t and micromonospora endolithica dsm 44398t all at 99 2 chemotaxonomic data including cell wall components major menaquinones and major fatty acids confirmed the affiliation of strain tms7t to the genus micromonospora the results of the phylogenetic analysis addition to physiological and biochemical studies in combination with dna dna hybridization allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain tms7t and the most closely related species with validly published names the name proposed for the novel species is micromonospora terminaliae sp nov the type strain is tms7t dsm 101760t nrrl b 65345t received 11 07 2016accepted 21 10 2016published online 01 02 2017keyword s

The genome within Stylonychia's macronucleus has a very unusual architecture, comprised variably and highly amplified \"nanochromosomes,\" each usually encoding a single gene with a minimal amount of surrounding noncoding DNA. As only a tiny fraction of the Stylonychia genes has been sequenced, and to promote research using this organism, we sequenced its macronuclear genome. We report the analysis of the 50.2-Mb draft S. lemnae macronuclear genome assembly, containing in excess of 16,000 complete nanochromosomes, assembled as less than 20,000 contigs. We found considerable conservation of fundamental genomic properties between S. lemnae and its close relative, Oxytricha trifallax, including nanochromosomal gene synteny, alternative fragmentation, and copy number. Protein domain searches in Stylonychia revealed two new telomere-binding protein homologs and the presence of linker histones. Among the diverse histone variants of S. lemnae and O. trifallax, we found divergent, coexpressed variants corresponding to four of the five core nucleosomal proteins (H1.2, H2A.6, H2B.4, and H3.7) suggesting that these ciliates may possess specialized nucleosomes involved in genome processing during nuclear differentiation. The assembly of the S. lemnae macronuclear genome demonstrates that largely complete, well-assembled highly fragmented genomes of similar size and complexity may be produced from one library and lane of Illumina HiSeq 2000 shotgun sequencing. The provision of the S. lemnae macronuclear genome sets the stage for future detailed experimental studies of chromatin-mediated, RNA-guided developmental genome rearrangements.

Thy-1 correlates inversely with fibrogenic phenotypic characteristics and functions as a \"fibrosis suppressor.\" Promoter region hypermethylation can silence Thy-1 expression in fibroblastic foci, suggesting that epigenetic regulation is important in programming the fibrotic phenotype. We examined whether histone modifications are important in regulating Thy-1 expression in lung fibroblasts. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) restored Thy-1 expression in Thy-1(-) cells in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent fashion and was associated with enrichment of histone acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated Thy-1 depletion of trimethylated H3K27 after 24 hours of TSA treatment, concurrent with enrichment of trimethylated H3K4 and acetylated H4. Bisulfite sequencing of the Thy-1 promoter region revealed demethylation of the previously hypermethylated CpG sites after treatment with TSA. Although Thy-1 was hypermethylated in Thy-1(-) lung fibroblasts, we observed that Thy-1(-) cells have lower global DNA methylation compared with Thy-1(+) lung fibroblasts, which was partially reversed by TSA treatment. TSA treatment up-regulates total methyltransferase activity in these cells. Our data indicate that Thy-1 silencing is regulated by histone modifications in addition to promoter hypermethylation in lung fibroblasts. Additionally, our findings indicate that alteration of histone modifications alters DNA methylation. Understanding the molecular hierarchy of events with respect to reactivation of transcription and reversal of histone modification will be critical to understand and modify the regulated expression of Thy-1, a tumor-supressor and fibrosis-suppressor gene.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

a matched pairs animal study objective to confirm the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging mri as a means of evaluating edema and fat degeneration of the multifidus muscle by comparing measurements made using mri with those made using histological examination summary of background data mri is considered a reliable means of evaluating multifidus muscle edema and fat degeneration however it is not clear whether its results are always consistent with histological findings methods models of different degrees of multifidus injury were created at the l2 l3 l3 l4 and l4 l5 disc levels in 56 new zealand white rabbits these were divided into 4 groups and subjected to different processes sham surgery dissection and stripping of the multifidus crushing of the muscle lasting 1 hour and crushing of the muscle lasting 2 hours two rabbits per group were examined at each of the indicated points in time multifidus edema was assessed using fat suppressed t2 signal intensity ratio of gross multifidus to psoas t2r on mri bilaterally wet weight and wet dry weight ratio on the left side edema left and visual edema score on the right side edema right muscle fat degeneration was detected bilaterally using the t1 signal intensity ratio of gross multifidus to psoas with mri t1r and visual fat degeneration score fat score with histology results pearson correlation coefficient analyses showed significant correlations p 0 001 between left t2r and edema left r 0 927 right t2r and edema right r 0 868 and t1r and fat score r 0 804 a paired t test demonstrated no significant differences between mri measurements and histological changes p 0 999 1 000 and 0 998 bland altman plots also depicted good agreement between mri measurements and histological changes limits of agreement left

correlation and agreement between the results of magnetic resonance imaging mri signal intensity ratio measurements and histological observations in the evaluation of multifidus muscle edema and fat degeneration were examined to determine the reliability of mri for the purpose of evaluating multifidus muscle injury and atrophy mri was found to be accurate 2014 by lippincott williams

an overcrowded profession and low fees as well as too many medical colleges and free clinics have each in turn received a great deal of attention with apparently no results unless upon the theory of suggestion it has increased the evils that are complained of this is no doubt more perceptible to clinicians than to others and having conducted a clinic for many years i may possibly be able to delineate a few occurrences that will prove interesting to the profession at large clinical teaching has been so emphasized by the colleges and by the demands of the profession that undue importance has been given to that feature in all colleges during the last few years so much so that the institutions that have advertised the greatest number of clinics have generally obtained the largest

identification of more than 50 different phenotypic changes ranging from increased anxiety and stress related behaviours to gut dysfunction bone weakness and late onset obesity with metabolic syndrome these multiple effects which can be amplified by gene environment and gene gene interactions are primarily attributable to altered intracellular and extracellular serotonin concentrations during development and adulthood much of the human data relating to altered expression of the gene that encodes sert are based on genetic association findings or correlations and are therefore not as robust as the experimental mouse results nevertheless sert function modifying gene variants in humans apparently produce many phenotypes that are similar to those that manifest themselves in mice access

administration of relatively low doses of many drugs spinal reflexesreflex actions that occur relatively quickly because the sensory neurons do not pass directly into the brain rather they synapse in

Optimization drives such analyses but previous studies have highlighted a large computational cost dictated by iterative use of nonlinear FE models. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a local regression-based adaptive surrogate modeling approach to decrease computational cost for both global and local optimization approaches using an inverse FE application. Nonlinear elastic material parameters for patient-specific heel-pad tissue were found, both with and without the surrogate model. Surrogate prediction replaced a FE simulation using local regression of previous simulations when the corresponding error estimate was less than a given tolerance. Performance depended on optimization type and tolerance value. The surrogate reduced local optimization expense up to 68%, but achieved accurate results for only 1 of 20 initial conditions. Conversely, up to a tolerance value of 20 N(2), global optimization with the surrogate yielded consistent parameter predictions with a concurrent decrease in computational cost (up to 77%). However, the local optimization method without the surrogate, although sensitive to the initial conditions, was still on average seven times faster than the global approach. Our results help establish guidelines for setting acceptable tolerance values while using an adaptive surrogate model for inverse FE analysis. Most important, the study demonstrates the benefits of a surrogate modeling approach for intensive FE-based iterative analysis.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

for commercial planting dianese et al 1984 alfenas et al 1997 carvalho et al 1998 xavier et al 2007 rust resistance varies according to species and provenance some species such as e tereticornis e resinifera e paniculata and e pellita are particularly resistant to the disease guimar es et al 2010a zauza et al 2010 in addition to the selection of resistant genotypes the genetic basis of this resistance has been described junghans et al 2003a studied the rust resistance inheritance in full sibling families of e grandis and found that most of the phenotypic variation of the defense response is controlled by a major effect gene named ppr1 puccinia psidii resistance gene 1 recently the locus ppr1 was placed on a genetic reference map of eucalypts in linkage group 3 and was validated in two unrelated families confirming the hypothesis that ppr1 controls a great portion of the variation in rust resistance mamani et al 2010 however further studies particularly in interspecific hybrids progenies indicated that the genetic control of rust resistance is complex teixeira et al 2009 alves et al 2011b since eucalypt plantations in brazil are based mainly on e grandis e urophylla and their hybrids the search for resistance genes in other species is a key strategy to expand the genetic basis of resistance and to breed plants with other genetic combinations recently guimar es et al 2010a selected e pellita clones as promising resistance sources for several eucalypts diseases including rust besides the rust e pellita has been shown as a potential source of resistance to other important diseases such as ceratocystis wilt ceratocystis fimbriata and leaf blight calonectria pteridis guimar es et al 2010a the objective of the present work was to identify the genetic basis of e pellita rust resistance based on controlled p psidii inoculations in four full sibling families material and methods plant material the genetic control of e pellita rust resistance was analyzed in 441 plants derived from four families as follows i the selfing of parent pe40 128 plants ii the cross between parents pe40 x pe18 130 plants iii the cross between parents pe40 x pe47 93 plants and iv the cross between parents pe40 x pe151 90 plants the parents were previously evaluated for rust resistance where pe18 pe40 and pe151 were resistant and pe47 was susceptible guimar es et al 2010a in the phenotyping performed by guimar es et al 2010a the clone pe40 was the most resistant showing immunity reaction pe151 showed hypersensitive reaction hr and pe18 presented hr with eventual presence of puntiform pustules on the other hand pe47 showed abundant sporulation being classified as susceptible inoculation seedlings of each family were labeled and then transplanted in 2 l pots containing substrate mecplant with 6 kg m 3 superphosphate and 3 kg m 3 osmocote 19 6 10 thirty days after transplanting the seedlings were inoculated with a suspension of a 2 x 104 urediniospore inoculum of the monopostular isolate ufv 2 of p psidii race 1 which is predominant in different regions of brazil junghans et al 2003a the isolate was maintained on seedlings of rose apple syzygium jambos by periodic reinoculations every 20 days inoculations were performed as described by ruiz et al 1989 after inoculation the seedlings were maintained in an intermitent mist irrigation chamber at 25 c in the dark for 24 h and then transferred to a growth chamber with a photoperiod of 12 h at a light intensity of 40 mmol s 1 m 2 and an average temperature of 22 c the inoculated rooted cuttings of the two e urophylla clones c1179 r and c1183 s were used for comparison resistance assessment the disease severity was assessed at 12 and 20 days after inoculation on a 4 point scale junghans et al 2003b that represents four severity classes based on the pustule size s0 immunity or hypersensitivity reaction hr with flecks or necrotic spots s1 small pustules diameter 0 8 mm s2 medium sized pustules diameter of 0 8 1 6 mm and s3 large pustules diameter 1 6 mm the s0 and s1 plants were considered resistant and the s2 and s3 plants were susceptible the final phenotype was based on evaluation 12 or 20 days that showed leaves with more abundant sporulation after the evaluations the mendelian assumptions of resistance segregation were tested by 2 p 0 05 using different genetic models the plants were pruned and the new shoots were inoculated again as described above to confirm the results disease evaluation was based on the same grading scale and on the averaged infected leaf area for evaluation of the leaf diseased area two leaves per plant with representative pustules of the plant phenotype were scanned and processed using quant vale et al 2003 in the second inoculation 105 plants of the cross pe40 x pe40 66 of pe40 x pe151 85 of pe40 x pe47 and 76 of pe40 x pe18 were evaluated the number of plants assessed in the second inoculation was lower than in the first because some of the plants died after pruning the genetic and phenotypic parameters were estimated using mixed linear models reml residual maximum likelihood and blup best linear unbiased prediction for the quantitative data analysis of the diseased leaf area the following mixed model was used y xr za e where y is the data vector r is the vector of replication effects assumed as fixed added to the overall mean a is the vector of additive genetic effects assumed as random and e is the error or residue vector random the capital letters represent the incidence matrices for these effects estimates of the variance components by reml and of the narrow sense heritability were obtained after fitting the model for the experiments with the families using the program selegen reml blup resende 2002 the estimator was used to compute the individual heritability in the narrow sense where 2a is the estimate of the additive genetic variance and 2e is the estimated residual variance the data were also subjected to repeatability analysis by measurements of the lesion area on two leaves per plant the following mixed model was used y xm wp e where y is the data vector m is the vector of measurement effects assumed as fixed added to the overall mean p is the vector of permanent plant effects genotypic effects permanent environmental effects assumed as random and e is the error or residue vector random the capital letters represent the incidence matrices for these effects the estimator was used to compute the individual repeatability where 2p is the estimate of the permanent phenotypic variance between plants and 2e is the estimated residual variance results and discussion the four progenies of e pellita segregated for rust resistance the number of resistant plants was always greater than the number of susceptible plants even in the pe40 x pe47 cross involving the susceptible parent pe47 table 1 this result corroborates the previous studies reporting e pellita as a good source of rust resistance carvalho et al 1998 guimar es et al 2010a zauza et al 2010 the pe40 x pe18 family had the lowest genotypic value i e the progeny derived from this cross had a higher frequency of resistant plants than the other three crosses evaluated and it is therefore the most suitable for the selection of rust resistant plants table 1 the cross pe40 x pe47 yielded plants with lowest frequency of resistant plants as it involved a susceptible parent and therefore had a higher genotypic value a wide spectrum of rust reaction was found among the genotypes inoculated as immunity note s0 resistant hypersensitivity reaction hr s0 resistant hr followed by puntiform pustules s1 resistant and abundant sporulation on leaves s2 and s3 susceptible and in petiole s3 susceptible the comparators clones c1179 r and c1183 s showed immune reaction s0 resistant and abundant sporulation s3 susceptible respectively since eucalypts can be cloned the fixation of genetic gains through the selection of a single superior plant is rapid fonseca et al 2010 thus selection of rust resistant clones based on the results of controlled inoculation can facilitate the use of genetic resistance in disease control however to ensure the long term success and to simplify the selection of resistant progeny plants the genetic control of the trait must be known for the transfer of resistance using controlled crosses the inheritance of rust resistance in eucalypts studied since the early 2000s junghans et al 2003a teixeira et al 2009 rosado et al 2010 alves et al 2011b has shown different models to explain the segregation patterns in the present study we tested three models of the genetic control of resistance based on major effect genes to explain the resistance segregation in progenies of e pellita table 2 in the first model rust resistance was considered to have a simple mendelian inheritance controlled by a major effect gene major gene according to this model and according to the phenotype of the parents guimar es et al 2010a pe18 pe40 and pe151 are heterozygous aa and the susceptible parent pe47 homozygous recessive aa for the gene that controls resistance in contrast to the report of junghans et al 2003a this model did not explain the monogenic segregation patterns for e grandis obtained in the present work the selfing progeny from the parent pe40 was the best to fit the proposed model p 30 7 two other families pe40 r x pe18 r and pe40 r x pe151 r also fitted a single gene hypothesis but with very low probability 5 4 and 11 3 respectively table 2 the deviations of the other family from the expected ratio were significant thus excluding the hypothesis of a monogenic dominant control of the rust resistance trait in e pellita in the second model the hypothesis of deleterious genes linked to the resistance genes interfering with the classic mendelian segregation pattern was evaluated according to this model the parents pe18 pe40 and pe151 are heterozygous for resistance aa whereas pe47 is recessive homozygous aa thus the progeny plants that presented homozygous resistance gene would not be viable by the chi square test the deviations of two progeny pe40 x pe18 and pe40 x pe47 from the expected ratio were significant excluding this second hypothesis as well table 2 in the third model the inheritance of rust resistance in e pellita was assumed to be digenic to test this model it was assumed that the resistant parents carry two genes in heterozigozity for the trait aabb and that the susceptible parent is recessive homozygous or heterozygous for one of the genes aabb a bb or aab however this model was only possible when the s1 plants as the parent pe18 previously classified as resistant guimar es et al 2010a were considered susceptible this model fitted well to the expected segregation ratios in the four crosses table 2 the classification of the s1 plants as resistant follows junghans et al 2003b for e grandis although considered resistant these plants present puntiform pustules thus it is possible that the s1 plants have no major effect resistance genes major genes but rather carry minor effect genes which retards or reduce fungal sporulation in this case despite being an accepted model it was assumed that minor effect genes affect significantly the resistance response leading to deviations from the expected segregation patterns of one or few genes other inheritance models based on few genes were also tested without success data not shown despite the absence of a single inheritance model that would explain the obtained segregation patterns without exception the high number of resistant plants suggests the involvement of major genes in rust resistance control figure 1 thus making it more plausible to consider rust resistance in e pellita as a complex trait controlled by genes of major and minor effects to demonstrate the role of minor effect genes in the rust resistance of e pellita different genetic parameters of the progeny were estimated table 3 the narrow sense heritability of rust resistance was estimated at 37 3 when evaluation of the disease was based on the rating scale junghans et al 2003b and at 32 7 on the infected leaf area in both cases the heritability was found to be moderate reinforcing the hypothesis that polygenes act in response to rust resistance in e pellita the values were similar to those reported by pinto et al 2014 for rust resistance in e dunnii progenies under controlled environment the repeatability coefficient was estimated at 92 which represents the highest limit that the broad sense heritability can achieve considering a possible low permanent environmental effect on the character it can be inferred that the broad sense heritability is high due to the large difference between the two heritability values it can also be inferred that the character has high allelic dominance and or epistasis discrepant heritability estimates in the broad and narrow sense were also reported by guimar es et al 2010b in the pathosystem eucalyptus canker chrysoporthe cubensis in e grandis x e urophylla hybrid progeny inoculated under field conditions the accuracy values found in the present study were high table 3 according to resende 1995 a greater selection accuracy results in higher accuracy and therefore a greater genetic gain the repeatability coefficient found in this study was 92 for the analyses of the mean percentage data of the infected leaf area table 3 with an accuracy of 96 these results indicated that a single leaf is sufficient to quantify the lesioned area using the program quant alves et al 2011b obtained a repeatability coefficient of 84 5 compared to two different disease assessments on a rating scale junghans et al 2003b of the same progeny our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the inoculation and the method of assessment using either a grading scale or diseased leaf area for the selection of rust resistant plants this is the first study regarding the inheritance of rust resistance in e pellita considering that the inheritance models of resistance based on one or two genes do not satisfactorily explain our results and that the moderate heritability values found in this work indicate the involvement of polygenes in the plant defense response it is believed that rust resistance in e pellita is controlled by major and minor effect genes major and minor genes a similar inheritance model involving genes controlling qualitative and quantitative trait has been demonstrated for the pathosystem melampsora populus bresson et al 2011 moreover these results are consistent with the hypothesis that much of the resistance is controlled by a major effect gene for example by ppr 1 in e grandis junghans et al 2003a and with the findings of alves et al 2011b who suggested the presence of major and minor effect genes that control resistance the understanding that both major and minor genes are involved in the defense response of eucalyptus spp to rust reveals the complexity of the host pathogen interaction and helps explain the success achieved in the cloning and selection of resistant

TNF-alpha levels of the mucoid MEEs were significantly higher than those of the serous type. However, TNF-alpha was rarely detected in the sera of OME patients or healthy controls. We observed significant differences between the serous and mucoid MEEs with respect to their sICAM-1 levels, which were also higher than serum slCAM-1 levels of OME patients and healthy controls.

described in the bacteriologicalcode 1990 revision authors and other individuals wishing to have new names and or combinations included in future lists should send three copies of the pertinent reprint or photocopies thereof or an electronic copy of the published paper to the ijsem editorial office for confirmation that all of the other requirements for valid publication have been met it is also a requirement of ijsem and the icsp that authors of new species new subspecies and new combinations provide evidence that types are deposited in two recognized culture collections in two different countries it should be noted that the date of valid publication of these new names and combinations is the date of publication of this list not the date of the original publication of the names and combinations the authors of the new names and combinations are as given below and these authors names will be included in the author index of the present issue inclusion of a name on these lists validates the publication of the name and thereby makes it available in the nomenclature of prokaryotes the inclusion of a name on this list is not to be construed as taxonomic acceptance of the taxon to which the name is applied indeed some of these names may in time be shown to be synonyms or the organisms may be transferred to another genus thus necessitating the creation of a new

We compared the organization of grey matter structural covariance and functional connectivity in ICNs between NCs and all AD patients who were amyloid \nResults: The patients with AD had increased functional interregional covariance among the regions of the ICN anchored to dorsal caudate (DC) seeds compared to the NCs. The increased connectivity was associated with extended patterns of reduced A\nConclusions: Functional connectivity in ICNs affects the topographic spread of molecular pathologies. The temporal trajectory of pathologic alterations can be well demonstrated by pathologic covariance comparisons between different clinical stages. Pathologic covariance can provide critical support to pathologic interactions at network and molecular levels.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

craftsman gave his son icarus a pair of wings built from feathers and wax along with the privilege to fly he gave his son strict instructions to neither fly too high to avoid being burnt by the sun nor to fly too low to risk drowning in the ocean icarus overcome with the feeling of freedom could not contain his hubris and soared toward the sun only to find that his melting wings left him plummeting into the sea this classic greek myth espouses the notion that both overly aggressive and prohibitively conservative approaches to life s challenges may come with inherent complications this analogy is particularly apt in the context of a world dominated by the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 named for the similarity between the virus and the corona of the sun pandemic that has altered human existence among the many changes brought on by covid 19 was the abrupt cessation of organized athletics professional sports mass participation endurance events school community based youth athletics the entire global sports community came to a grinding halt as the acute phase of the covid 19 pandemic begins to slow there is a growing clamor to resume normal living including the reemergence of sport the immediate positive impacts of return to the fields of play on athletes spectators and the global sporting industry are clear the implications with respect to cardiovascular health and wellness are less clear and deserve careful consideration covid 19 has proven to be a highly infectious lethal disease that impacts the cardiovascular system the development of covid 19 related acute myocardial injury represents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that have dragged cardiovascular specialists back into the medical intensive care unit additionally persistent myocardial edema fibrosis and impaired function have recently been documented after recovery from infection 1 however the virtual absence of cardiovascular testing among people with asymptomatic or mild clinical covid 19 leaves uncertain the frequency that these patients representing the majority of covid affected individuals will experience cardiac involvement unrecognized cardiac complications after covid 19 infection have the real potential to impact the safe resumption of competitive sports and exercise occult myocarditis may be underappreciated as a cause of sudden cardiac arrest sca in young athletes before the covid 19 pandemic for example us military data suggest that myocarditis is the leading killer of recruits in basic training 2 moreover analyses of sca among collegiate athletes suggest autopsy negative death is a more common cause of death than inherited cardiomyopathies and it is unlikely that undetected inherited arrhythmia syndromes are causal as mandatory ecg screening in italy did not reduce sca from these causes 3 perhaps most worrisome recent data suggest that out of hospital sca increased nearly 60 in italy during the covid 19 epidemic compared with the previous 1 year period 4 although the majority of these deaths were in older people the data raise the disturbing possibility that sca during athletics will spike during recovery from this pandemic and novel approaches to screening surveilling and managing athletes deserve consideration protecting the health of the athlete is not a new topic sca during sport attributable to underlying heart disease is well recognized and screening for the commonly responsible genetic and congenital diseases is widely recommended owing to the absence of longitudinal outcome data there are differing opinions about how best to perform preparticipation cardiovascular screening the 2 authors of this essay have studied and debated the utility of various screening techniques for years and we continue to share some differences on this topic especially regarding the roles of 12 lead electrocardiography and medical history for sca prevention however we collectively believe that the covid 19 pandemic should change the nature of the discussion regarding preparticipation screening the resumption of organized athletics at every level will involve some form of medical clearance we propose that all screening efforts should define and manage the cardiac footprints of covid 19 infection this should include ascertainment of the likelihood of covid 19 infection as documented by a prior positive antigen test exposure to a known carrier or symptoms compatible with disease among athletes with definite or possible previous infection the use of adjunctive testing including electrocardiography cardiac biomarkers noninvasive imaging and exercise testing represent appropriate options for more definitive risk stratification there will be no one size fits all approach to this process and we encourage sports medicine and cardiology practitioners to dictate testing choices based on available resources and expertise the authors along with other sports cardiology experts have proposed an algorithm for this process figure 5 in addition strategies that ensure the safe return of spectators to sporting venues including physical distancing and virtual attendance and perhaps antigen and antibody testing are warranted download figuredownload powerpointfigure coronavirus disease 2019 return to play algorithm for competitive athlete and highly active people typical testing obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab all athletes with positive testing should be isolated for 2 weeks regardless of symptoms if clinical or cardiac symptoms develop follow appropriate clinical pathway given lack of clear pathophysiology we recommend the american college of cardiology american heart association athlete myocarditis guidelines cahap indicates competitive athlete or highly active person covid 19 coronavirus disease 2019 hstn high sensitivity troponin i and rtp return to play reproduced with permission from jama cardiology5 copyright 2020 american medical association all rights reserved in parallel with strategies to identify potentially high risk complications of previous covid 19 infection this is a critical time for focused and collaborative scientific inquiry if covid 19 leads to residual cardiovascular pathology it is possible that the superimposition of high intensity high volume exercise will increase the risk of adverse outcomes including sca concerted efforts to document outcomes and to rigorously compare prevention and therapeutic strategies represent a scientific imperative this will best be accomplished through the creation of a national registry of sca that incorporates the clinical pathological and socioeconomic information required to test intervention strategies this database should be developed as part of a coordinated national effort to define the comprehensive consequences of the covid 19 pandemic finally it is prudent to follow a scientifically guided stepwise approach to the resumption of sports corresponding with availability of accurate antigen and antibody testing and ultimately vaccination an incremental strategy will maximize health and safety of athletes spectators and the economic industry that binds them and each will require different approaches an overly tentative return to sport will delay the numerous benefits that come from competitive athletics conversely an overly aggressive return could result in unexpected adverse outcomes in athletes and re emergence of infection as a result of social crowding during sporting events emerging signs of the resolution of the covid 19 pandemic are stimulating powerful urges to resume normal life including sport but like icarus we must remember that new found freedom comes with responsibility and that timing and strategy will be everything disclosuresnone footnoteshttps www

We assessed whether NAFLD is associated with abnormalities in cardiac function in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 50 consecutive type 2 diabetic individuals without a history of ischemic heart disease, hepatic diseases, or excessive alcohol consumption, in whom NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. A tissue Doppler echocardiography with myocardial strain measurement was performed in all patients.\nRESULTS: Thirty-two patients (64%) had NAFLD, and when compared with the other 18 patients, age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, smoking, diabetes duration, microvascular complication status, and medication use were not significantly different. In addition, the left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes, ejection fraction, systemic vascular resistance, arterial elasticity, and compliance were also not different. NAFLD patients had lower e' (8.2 ± 1.5 vs. 9.9 ± 1.9 cm/s, P < 0.005) tissue velocity, higher E-to-e' ratio (7.90 ± 1.3 vs. 5.59 ± 1.1, P < 0.0001), a higher time constant of isovolumic relaxation (43.1 ± 10.1 vs. 33.2 ± 12.9 ms, P < 0.01), higher LV-end diastolic pressure (EDP) (16.5 ± 1.1 vs. 15.1 ± 1.0 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and higher LV EDP/end diastolic volume (0.20 ± 0.03 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02 mmHg, P < 0.05) than those without steatosis. Among the measurements of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rate, those with NAFLD also had higher E/global longitudinal diastolic strain rate during the early phase of diastole (E/SR(E)). All of these differences remained significant after adjustment for hypertension and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show that in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, even if the LV morphology and systolic function are preserved, early features of LV diastolic dysfunction may be detected.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

objectivesfluorodeoxyglucose fdg avidity as measured by the maximum standard uptake value suv at baseline and after induction chemotherapy ct on positron emission tomography pet imaging has been shown to be prognostic in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma however the role of fdg pet in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma scc has not been well established we investigated the prognostic significance of various fdg metrics in a cohort of esophageal scc patients treated with chemoradiation crt materials methodswe identified 58 esophageal scc patients with fully analyzable fdg pet data at baseline post induction ct and post crt all patients received concurrent crt of which 53 patients also received induction ct and 11 patients underwent surgery following crt median radiation dose was 5040 cgy range 5040 5600 cgy all scans were independently analyzed by a nuclear medicine physician blinded to patient outcome using region of interest analysis max and mean standardized uptake

metrics resultsmedian follow up was 3 8 years with median survival for all patients of 2 9 years the 3 year os dfs dmfs and lrfs rates were 49 47 43 and 42 respectively using a pre established cutoff of a 35 decrease in suvmax from baseline to post induction pet 3 yr os for responders 35 decrease from baseline was 52 whereas nonresponders 35 decrease from baseline had a 3 yr os of 21 p 0 046 baseline suvmax suvpeak mtv and tlg were significantly associated with os lrfs dfs and dmfs on post induction pet suvmax suvpeak mtv and tlg were significantly associated with os lrfs dmfs and dfs after completion of crt only suvmax was prognostic for os while only suvmax and tlg were prognostic for dmfs conclusionbaseline and post induction pet metrics were most prognostic in patients with esophageal scc our data confirms a 35 decrease in suvmax after induction ct as established in the adenocarcinoma literature is also a significant predictor of os in esophageal scc patients this analysis demonstrates that in addition to suvmax volumetric pet metrics may also be useful in predicting outcomes oral scientific abstract 12 tablehazard ratio for significant pet metrics based on

However, the clinical significance of such heterogeneity has not been systematically evaluated yet. We were to elucidate and find the clinical significance of heterogeneity for TSH receptor antibodies in Graves' disease.\nMETHODS: We measured stimulating TSHRAb (TSAb) activities using CHO-hTSHR cells, FRTL-5 cells and chimeric receptor expressing cells (Mc1 + 2 and Mc2), specific blocking TSHRAb (TSBAb) activities using Mc2 cells and TBII activities using porcine thyroid membrane in 136 patients with untreated hyperthyroid Graves' disease.\nRESULTS: Based on various TSHRAb activities from each patient, the patients could be categorized into 7 subgroups by cluster analysis; 1) Group 1 (n = 41) was characterized by moderate TSAb activities both in CHO-hTSHR cells and in FRTL-5 cells, typical TSAb epitope, rare blocking antibodies and high TBII activities. 2) Group 2 (n = 16) was characterized by the presence of blocking TSHRAb in most patients, albeit the other characteristics were the same as those in Group 1. 3) Group 3 (n = 19) patients had low TSAb activities both in CHO-hTSHR cells and in FRTL-5 cells, seldom had blocking TSHRAb, but they had high TBII activities. 4) Group 4 (n = 30) could be categorized as 'mild disease' group, as they had low activities in all kinds of TSHRAb assay and had low antimicrosomal antibody activities. 5) Group 5 (n = 14) was characterized by moderate TSAb activities with atypical epitope(s), rare blocking TSHRAb and moderate TBII activities. 6) Group 6 (n = 10) patients had very high TSAb activities with typical epitopes, seldom blocking TSHRAb and low TBII activities. 7) Group 7 (n = 6) was characterized by very high TSAb activities with atypical epitopes and high TBII activities. Pretreatment serum thyroid hormone level was low only in group 4 patients compared to the other 6 groups (p < 0.05). The size of goiter was significantly larger in those in group 1 and group 3 (p < 0.05) compared to the other 5 groups. The prevalence of clinically significant ophthalmopathy was higher in group 2 patients than the other 6 groups (50% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.06). Among 6 kinds of TSHRAb activities, only the blocking TSHRAb activity was significantly associated with the presence of ophthalmopathy in multivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that the differences in epitopes for TSAb or the presence of blocking TSHRAb is not a major factor in determining the degree of thyrotoxicosis in Graves' disease. Although the pathogenic mechanism is not clear yet, we suggest that patients with ophthalmopathy have different TSHRAb repertoire from those without ophthalmopathy in Graves' disease.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

arteries methods and resultsseparate suspensions of a polymorphonuclear cells 95 and b mononuclear cells 85 lymphocytes 10 monocytes 5 polymorphonuclear cells respectively were obtained from the arterial blood of four groups of adult male mongrel dogs unoperated dogs controls dogs with single lung autotransplants dogs with rejecting single lung allotransplants and unoperated dogs treated with the same immunosuppressants as allotransplanted dogs these suspensions were added to rings of control intralobar pulmonary arteries suspended in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force the endothelium was removed mechanically from selected rings no significant change in basal tension of pulmonary arterial rings occurred by adding suspensions of polymorphonuclear cells from any of the four groups of dogs significant cell number dependent increases in tension occurred with suspensions of mononuclear cells from unoperated dogs autotransplanted dogs and unoperated medicated dogs these increases in tension were less in rings with compared to those without endothelium addition of a synthetic analogue of l arginine abolished this difference suspensions of mononuclear cells from rejecting allotransplanted dogs caused significantly greater contractions in rings with endothelium than those observed with suspended cells from either unoperated autotransplanted dogs or unoperated medicated dogs addition of superoxide dismutase plus catalase or an antagonist of endothelin a receptors bq 123 reduced contractions in rings with endothelium but not in those without endothelium to suspensions of mononuclear cells from rejecting allotransplanted dogs conclusionsthe results of this study suggest that mononuclear cells cause contraction of pulmonary arteries which can be partially inhibited by endothelium derived nitric oxide however if the mononuclear cells are activated by acute pulmonary rejection contractions are no longer inhibited by the endothelium under conditions of

Chest tube drainage was measured at 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. The rate of transfusion and the amount of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets transfused were recorded.\nRESULTS: A total of 237(76%) patients underwent MRI after surgery. 39 (14%, [95% CI, 10.2 to 18.0]) patients experienced severe anxiety caused by a fear of enclosed space in the MRI coil necessitating termination of the procedure. Patients with claustrophobia were on average 5 years younger. They were more likely to have diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Patients with claustrophobia had increased chest tube drainage during the postoperative period. The rate of blood product transfusion was similar between the two groups but patients with claustrophobia who were transfused received significantly more RBC and FFP than patients without claustrophobia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postoperative claustrophobia and anxiety, leading to inability to undergo MRI, may be more common than previously described.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

using a contact exposure experiment direct immunofluorescent method and serum hi titer 1 five of the nine reactive groups of reactive dyes 2 chloropyridine 2 4 6 trichloropyrimidine vinylsulfonic acid epichlorohydrin and beta chloroethylamine induced complete or almost complete defense in the entire respiratory tract and the four other vaccines brought about slight infection in the respiratory tracts there was no marked rise in serum hi titers post exposure despite uneven development 2 of the four sizable substituted as naphthol vaccines naphthol as irg and as g vaccines elicited nearly complete defense but the two other vaccines inactivated with more elongated molecules invited rare and successive infections the three immune groups produced invariably high serum hi titers 3 of the six naphthalene derivative vaccines two 3 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid methylester and 2 naphthol 6 sulfonic acid induced complete or almost complete protection but two vaccines brought about less protection and the remaining two vaccines caused heavy infections 4 of the six benzene derivative vaccines both m nitrobenzenesulfonic acid and isatoic anhydride induced complete protection three vaccines permitted slight infections but 2 4 6 trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid vaccine caused severe infection 5 of the seven food dye vaccines only orange i induced complete or nearly complete defense while the other dye vaccines were inferior in effect twelve inactivated sendai nasal vaccines modified the ribose and or phosphate groups of the virus core rna through five groups of small sized molecules with specially fixed side chains and elicited complete or almost complete respiratory mucosal defense the viral stabilization requiring the least alteration of the configuration will be

Elevated activity of the AR is often associated with this highly aggressive disease state. Therefore, new therapeutic regimens that target and modulate AR activity could prove beneficial. We previously introduced a versatile chemical platform to generate competitive and non-competitive multivalent peptoid oligomer conjugates that modulate AR activity. In particular, we identified a linear and a cyclic divalent ethisterone conjugate that exhibit potent anti-proliferative properties in LNCaP-abl cells, a model of castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action of these compounds utilizing confocal microscopy, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, chromatin immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and microarray analysis. The linear conjugate competitively blocks AR action by inhibiting DNA binding. In addition, the linear conjugate does not promote AR nuclear localization or co-activator binding. In contrast, the cyclic conjugate promotes AR nuclear localization and induces cell-cycle arrest, despite its inability to compete against endogenous ligand for binding to AR in vitro. Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that gene transcripts are differentially affected by treatment with the linear or cyclic conjugate. Although the divalent ethisterone conjugates share extensive chemical similarities, we illustrate that they can antagonize the AR via distinct mechanisms of action, establishing new therapeutic strategies for potential applications in AR pharmacology.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

It is based on the generation of a shuttle vector by recombination between a bacterial and a mammalian vector. The recombinants can thus be amplified in mammalian cells, isolated by plasmid rescue in an Escherichia coli RecA- host, and identified by in situ hybridization, by using mammalian vector sequences as probes. Since both parental molecules can share defined lengths of homology, this assay permits a direct comparison between homologous and nonhomologous intermolecular recombination. Our results indicate that the dominant intermolecular recombination mechanism is a nonhomologous one. The relative frequency of homologous to nonhomologous recombination was influenced by the length of shared homology between parental molecules and the replicative state of the parental molecules, but not by the introduction of double-strand breaks per se.

However, the cost of biodiesel remains much higher than diesel from fossil fuel sources, partially due to the high costs of oil extraction from algae. Here, we identified the presence of a sporopollenin layer outside the polysaccharide cell wall; this was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy, 2-aminoethanol treatment, acetolysis, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. We also performed bioinformatics analysis of the genes of the C. protothecoides genome that are likely involved in sporopollenin synthesis, secretion, and translocation, and evaluated the expression of these genes via real-time PCR. We also found that that removal of this sporopollenin layer greatly improved the efficiency of oil extraction. ", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

stenosis is not simple it consists of a combination of wall thickening and a change in cavity size with associated effects on systolic and diastolic function it is determined by numerous factors in addition to the transaortic resistance these include coexistent coronary disease and hypertension but also sex age and genetic factors this review will give evidence to suggest that aortic stenosis should be regarded as a clinical syndrome involving the left ventricle as well as the aortic valve this carries the implication that the left ventricle should be given greater priority when assessing and treating aortic stenosis effect of pressure load on the left ventriclepressure overload causes left ventricular lv remodelling and ultimately hypertrophy w1 w2 this is often seen as a means of limiting wall stress in order to maintain systolic function w2 wall stress by the law of laplace is related directly to intracavitary pressure and cavity size but inversely to wall thickness concentric remodelling is defined by a normal lv mass associated with an increased relative wall thickness fig 1 this is usually calculated as 2 posterior wall thickness lv diastolic diameter and a value 0 45 is abnormal w3 w4 the reduction in cavity size and increase in wall thickness tend to offset the raised intracavitary pressure associated with aortic stenosis concentric hypertrophy is defined by a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy and increased relative wall thickness patients with aortic stenosis and no hypertrophy almost invariably have concentric remodelling w4 6figure 1 diagram of left ventricular hypertrophy lvh and geometric remodelling concentric remodelling is defined by normal left ventricular mass but a relative wall thickness above 0 45 concentric hypertrophy is defined by lvh with a relative wall thickness above 0 45 eccentric hypertrophy as occurs in aortic regurgitation is defined by lvh but with normal relative wall thickness bsa view full

onemailfacebooktwitterlinked inredditwechatabstractrecent molecular biological chemical physiological and morphological studies indicate that trichosporon cutaneum and related species should be reclassified in this study antigenic characteristics of the species were determined the results of adsorption experiments revealed that there were at least three serological types i ii and iii specific factor sera i ii and iii were prepared on the basis of adsorption experiments and isolates were serotyped by cell slide agglutination csa since the csa test was difficult to read in some strains the results of the csa test were compared with the findings from an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa for the elisa crude polysaccharide antigens prepared from the culture supernatant were used as the antigen the types determined by elisa correlated well with those determined by the csa test these data suggest that t cutaneum and related species have at least three serological types and that the typing can be done by either csa or elisa abbreviationscsacell slide agglutinationelisaenzyme linked immunosorbent assaypbsphosphate buffered salinepbs tpbs containing 0 05 tween

window abstract the larval critical weight lcw in the spotted stem borer chilo partellus swinhoe lepidoptera pyralidae was 54 6 1 0 mg for average sized male and female final instar larvae and was 63 and 39 of the larval maximum weight lmw of males and females respectively there was a consistent decrease in weight from lmw to pupal weight of 35 in both males and females over successive generations of rearing two laboratory populations the adult weight was consistently about 37 and 22 lower than the pupal weight for males and females respectively during starvation 25 of the final instar larvae produced a supernumerary moult a positive correlation was derived between female pupal weight and fecundity the results were similar to those derived from a study on the progeny of a wild population a model representing the various fresh weight changes in relation to the lmw has been suggested for this species the model is similar to that proposed for other lepidoptera the results of this study are largely consistent with those carried out on other species of lepidoptera and underline the value of using stable standards in assessing the quality of laboratory reared insects r sum le poids critique de la larve lcw chez chilo partellus swinhoe lepidoptere pyralidae a ete de 54 1 0 mg pour des larves de dernier stade males et femelles de tailles moyennes alors que le poids maximal de larve lmw a t de 63 et 39 pour les males et les femelles respectivement il y eu une baisse consid rable de poids de 35 du lmw au poids de la pupe aussi bien chez les males que chez les femelles pendant des g n rations successives de deux populations l vees au laboratoire le poids des adults a ete constamment de 37 et 22 en dessous du poids de la pupe pour les males et les femelles respectivement durant les p riodes de je n 25 des larves du dernier stade ont eu une mue suplementaire il y a eu correlation positive entre le poids de la pupe female et sa f condite les r sultats ont t comparables a ceux obtenus pendant l etude sur la prog niture d une population naturelle un model repr sentant les diff rents changements en poids frais en relation avec le lmw a t sugg r pour cette esp ce ce model est semblable a celui propose pour d autres especes de l pidoptere les resultats de cette etude concorde bien avec ceux des travaux effectu s sur d autres esp ces de lepidopt re et

hormone agonists lhrh a of varying duration are available for treatment of prostate cancer pca previous reports suggest that utilization of longer acting lhrh a may reduce the number of healthcare visits thereby reducing the costs of managing pca patients in this study we investigated the frequency of patient follow up with respect to use of 1 3 and 4 month depot formulations in a cohort of patients with pca from a large healthcare system in the united states methods data from pca patients identified in the henry ford health system hfhs as international classification of diseases for oncology icd o code c61 9 in the tumor registry were extracted the following patients were included full staging information at index and the same dosage of lhrh a during the duration of the follow up patients with prior primary tumor types were excluded results 653 patients receiving the same depot of lhrh a through the duration of agonist treatment were identified 44 1 caucasians mean age 72 9 2 mean gleason score 7 2 median psa 10 5 there was no significant difference with depot switchers excluded from the analysis patients receiving 1 3 and 4 month depot formulations had 25 29 and 41 days between any pca related visits patients on the 1 month depot had 51 days between visits to urologists while patients on 3 and 4 month depots had 46 and 60 days between urologist visits respectively for patients receiving 1 month depot there was no significant difference between the actual time between pca related follow up visits and expected time between follow up visits mean difference 5 days p 0 1923 however patients receiving 3 month mean difference 61 days p 0 0001 and 4 month mean difference 79 days p 0 0001 depot formulations had significantly less time than expected between pca related follow up visits conclusions although it was expected that the depot formulation would have a significant impact on the interval between pca related visits the data did not support this the results of this study suggest that patients frequency of follow up with health care providers is not influenced by lhrh a depot formulations author disclosure employment or leadership consultant or

Each eye has two retinas: a distal retina that is closer to the lens, and a proximal retina that lies directly underneath. The distal retinas of E1 and E2 are made of a dorsal and a ventral stack of at least twelve photoreceptor layers. Could this arrangement be used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration, with shorter wavelengths detected by the distal layers and longer wavelengths by the proximal layers? To answer this question we molecularly identified opsins and their expression patterns in these eyes. We found three opsin-encoding genes. The distal retinas of all six eyes express long-wavelength opsin (TmLW) mRNA, whereas the proximal retinas express ultraviolet opsin (TmUV I) mRNA. In the proximal retinas of E1 and E2, the TmUV I mRNA is expressed only in the dorsal stack. A second ultraviolet opsin mRNA (TmUV II), is expressed in the proximal retinas of E1 and E2 (both stacks). The finding that longer-wavelength opsins are expressed distally to shorter-wavelength opsins makes it unlikely that this retinal arrangement is used to compensate for lens chromatic aberration.

Here, we employed a streptozotocin-induced rat model (STZ-DM) of uncontrolled insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus (uDM) to investigate the contribution of HPA axis suppression to leptin-mediated glucose lowering. Specifically, we asked if HPA axis activation is required for diabetic hyperglycemia, whether HPA axis normalization can be achieved using a dose of leptin below that needed to normalize glycemia, and if the ability of leptin to lower plasma glucocorticoid levels is required for its antidiabetic action. In STZ-DM rats, neither adrenalectomy-induced (ADX-induced) glucocorticoid deficiency nor pharmacological glucocorticoid receptor blockade lowered elevated blood glucose levels. Although elevated plasma levels of corticosterone were normalized by i.v. leptin infusion at a dose that raises low plasma levels into the physiological range, diabetic hyperglycemia was not altered. Lastly, the potent glucose-lowering effect of continuous intracerebroventricular leptin infusion was not impacted by systemic administration of corticosterone at a dose that maintained elevated plasma levels characteristic of STZ-DM. We conclude that, although restoring low plasma leptin levels into the physiological range effectively normalizes increased HPA axis activity in rats with uDM, this effect is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain leptin's antidiabetic action.

Motor phenotypes are determined by the anatomy of the underlying neuropathology and the common defining elements underlying their heterogeneity are that motor neuron degeneration is fundamentally a focal process and that it spreads contiguously through the 3-dimensional anatomy of the UMN and LMN levels, thus causing seemingly complex and varied clinical manifestations. This suggests motor neuron degeneration in ALS is in actuality a very orderly and actively propagating process and that fundamental molecular mechanisms may be uniform and their chief properties deduced. This also suggests opportunities for translational research to seek pathobiology directly in the less affected regions of the nervous system.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

effectiveness of three techniques to deliver a diazo dye suspension into the lungs of rats was compared the intratracheal nebulization itn technique delivered 10 l of the suspension per 5 ml puff of air in 10 puffs as an aerosol the intratracheal fast instillation itfi technique delivered 100 l of the suspension in a single 2 ml puff of air as droplets the nose only inhalation ni technique aerosolized the suspension at an analytical concentration that provided a calculated dose equivalent to 100 l of the suspension in a 2 h inhalation period immediately after dosing all the rats were killed by exsanguination the trachea was tied and the lung was inflated in situ with air after fixation 5 m thick slices were prepared from each lobe of the lung at a plane perpendicular to the axis of the lobar bronchus at levels proximal medial and distal to the hilus the numbers of bronchi bronchioli and alveolar ducts within four ranges of diameters and the proportion of each selected area of lung tissue with and without dye particles were quantified using electronic imaging analyzers the results indicated that itn and itfi dispersed the particles evenly throughout most of the airways and in patches in the alveoli the ni technique dispersed the particles homogeneously throughout the airways and the alveoli in the lungs the mean number percentage and the mean area percentage data revealed that the doses delivered by itn and ni were approximately 60 and 10 respectively of the itfi dose thus the itfi technique appeared to be most suitable for pulmonary absorption and disposition studies where dosage precision is of primary concern the itn technique would need further improvement to meet the requirements for dose precision and particle distribution for both itfi and itn particle size was apparently not a critical determinant for deposition the ni technique is suitable for inhalation toxicity studies where the pattern and uniformity of particle deposition is the primary concern 1998 john wiley sons ltd citing literaturenumber of times cited according to crossref 69nadia s orona francisco astort guillermo a maglione sebastian a ferraro maximiliano martin

members of three generation family strongly affected by coeliac disease cd excepting this one other autoimmune diseases ad such as type 1 diabetes t1d and systemic lupus erythematodes sle were diagnosed within the family the key role of genetic predisposition play alleles encoding the hla molecules hla dqa1 0501 and hla dqb1 02 encoding hla dq2 molecule hla dqa1 0301 and hla dqb1 0302 encoding hla dq8 molecule both associated with cd and t1d hla drb1 0301 and hla drb1 1501 associated with sle we studied a correlation between presence of hla alleles and manifestation of these ad methods peripheral blood dna was used for detection of hla alleles by the pcr ssp technique for statistical verification was used fisher s exact test with 95 confidence interval results we confirmed a linkage between hla dq2 molecule and manifestation of cd and t1d p 0 0003 rr 0 1765 ci 0 06318 0 4929 with the strongest effect of hla dqb1 0201 allele p 0 0119 rr 0 2059 ci 0 05966 0 7105 we have not confirmed hla drb1 0301 and hla drb1 1501 alleles in member with sle conclusion the prevalence of cd in family is strongly associated with carriage of hla dq2 molecule only one member of the family carrying this molecule has manifested t1d with regard to preponderant manifestation of cd in family we suppose in this person influence of some other genes shifting manifestation of autoimmunity towards t1d the unknown genetic factors are probably responsible for case of sle thus proving existence of complex genetic predisposition to various autoimmune diseases in family testing of other

the headspace the results show that the oxygen content of plastic pouches containing air 30 ml was reduced from 21 to 1 by 6 min illumination the scavenging rate depended on the light intensity and

the treatment of patients with mets regularly includes drugs prescribed simultaneously to treat several disorders that manifest at the same time such as hypercholesterolemia arterial hypertension and diabetes to the authors best knowledge there is no previous published analytical method for the simultaneous quantification of drugs used in the treatment of these diseases in the present study a rapid high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector hplc dad methodology was developed for simultaneous quantification of carvedilol cvd telmisartan tel bezafibrate bzt gliclazide

anesthetics during mechanical ventilation in the late stages of the disease covid 19 is thought to hit the human body via five major mechanisms direct viral damage immune overactivation capillary thrombosis loss of alveolar capillary membrane integrity and decreased tissue oxygenation the overproduction of pro inflammatory cytokines will eventually lead to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs which will lead to ards requiring mechanical ventilation respiratory failure resulting from ards is thought to be the most common cause of death in covid 19 the literature suggests that these effects could be directly countered by using volatile anesthetics for sedation these agents possess multiple properties that affect viral replication immunity and coagulation they also have proven benefits at the molecular cellular and tissue levels based on the comprehensive understanding of the literature short term sedation with volatile anesthetics may be beneficial in severe stages

After quantification of toluene degradation rates in soil, DNA was extracted from soil incubated with H(2)(18)O, H(2)(16)O, H(2)(16)O and 48 ppm toluene, or H(2)(18)O and 48 ppm toluene. A single DNA band formed along a cesium chloride gradient after isopycnic centrifugation of extracts from soils incubated with H(2)(16)O. With extracts from soils to which only H(2)(18)O was added, two distinct DNA bands formed, while three bands formed when DNA extracted from soil incubated with both H(2)(18)O and toluene was analyzed. We suggest that this third band formed because toluene does not contain any oxygen atoms and toluene-degrading organisms had to transfer oxygen atoms from H(2)(18)O into metabolic intermediates to form nucleic acids de novo. We extracted the third DNA band and amplified a large fraction of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Direct sequencing of the PCR product obtained from the labeled DNA, as well as cloned 16S rRNA amplicons, identified a known toluene degrader, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. A toluene-degrading bacterial strain was subsequently isolated from soil and shown to be Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 increased in soil after toluene exposure but not in soils from which toluene was withheld. This study indicates that H(2)(18)O DNA-SIP can be a useful method for identifying pollutant-degrading bacteria in soil.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

subunits contribute to the overall activity of the molecule and a few serve an important regulatory function within the enzyme complex many nonenzymes enzymes bear no similarity in function to their ancestral enzyme nonenzyme precursors and such relationships present a major challenge in the inference of function from sequence and structure indeed with the proliferation of biological data over the last few years the extent of evolutionary and functional diversification is only just being realized 7todd a e orengo c a thornton j m evolution of function in protein superfamilies from a

and nonenzyme proteins biological implicationsthe recent growth in biological data has revealed the functional versatility of many protein superfamilies it is not uncommon for a single fold to support a variety of both enzyme and nonenzyme functions understanding the molecular basis for these functional variations is essential for protein design and for the success of the structural genomics projects in which we hope to derive functional information from the structures of uncharacterized proteins this sequence structural and functional analysis of enzyme and nonenzyme homologs provides new insights into nature s ways of adapting old proteins for new functions typically active sites are disrupted by point mutations and more gross structural rearrangements in the adaptation of catalytic folds for nonenzyme functions ancestral binding sites are usually exploited for gain of enzyme function in some enzyme complexes having multiple copies of a catalytic ancestral domain one or more duplicates have lost activity to nevertheless enhance or refine the overall activity of the protein the functional similarities and differences in these proteins are often discernible only with the structural data regardless of pairwise sequence identity these results have implications in genome analysis in the prediction of function from sequence and structure acknowledgementsa e t

arrays with localized coil sensitivity make it possible to use parallel imaging to significantly accelerate mr imaging speed however the need for auto calibration signals limits the actual acceleration factors achievable with large arrays this paper presents a novel method for parallel imaging with large arrays the method uses sinc kernels for k space data interpolation that only requires one phase parameter to be estimated using a small size of calibration signals simulations based on synthetic array data and phantom experiments show that the new method can achieve higher actual acceleration factors with comparable reconstruction quality magn reson med 2011 2011 wiley liss inc parallel imaging pi is a technique that can significantly accelerate data acquisition speed with the help of an array of coils each of which has a unique spatial sensitivity the underlying sensitivity encoding can help to recover missing data in an accelerated data acquisition process e g skipped phase encoding steps some of the pi methods utilize sensitivity directly such as sensitivity encoding for fast magnetic resonance imaging mri sense 1 simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics smash 2 sensitivity profiles from an array of coils for encoding and reconstruction in parallel space rip 3 and partially parallel imaging with localized sensitivities pils 4 those methods require a measurement or estimate of receive coil sensitivities to solve an inverse problem the other methods indirectly use the effect of spatial encoding by coil sensitivity in a system model it is assumed that the k space data are correlated and the missing k space data can be recovered e g by interpolation methods of this kind include generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions grappa 5 multicolumn multiline interpolation mcmli 6 7 and iterative self consistent parallel imaging reconstruction from arbitrary k space spirit 8 and are categorized as the k domain reconstruction methods 9 the k space data correlation in these methods comes from two sources 1 inner channel correlation mainly from the localized coil sensitivity which corresponds to a wide k space spreading and 2 inter channel correlation due to the shared spatial information between receiver coils covering overlapped areas as a tendency in mri coil development the number of coil elements keeps growing and the individual elements become smaller with more localized sensitivities 10 12 thus optimized reconstruction kernel should be chosen based on sensitivity as has been discussed in 13 16 a unique characteristic of large arrays is that the coil sensitivity is highly localized as a result the inner channel data correlation is strong and the interchannel data correlation is relative weak when compared with the conventional coil arrays therefore the image reconstruction will rely more on inner channel than interchannel correlation in larger arrays in the k domain pi this means that the interpolation kernels need to cover a larger k space area and span fewer overlapped channels 7 in the image domain method pils 4 the interchannel correlation is completely ignored large arrays by virtue of the large number of parallel receive channels are potential to achieve high acceleration factors in the aforementioned methods however in practice the actual achieved acceleration factor is limited by the need for auto calibration signals acs which require additional acquisition time the size of acs is proportional to both the acceleration factor and the kernel size when a large number of acs has to be acquired the actual acceleration factor is reduced in this article a novel method parallel magnetic resonance imaging using localized receive arrays with sinc interpolation pilars that uses predetermined real sinc coefficients with complex phase term is proposed the method uses sinc kernels for k space data interpolation that only requires one phase parameter to be estimated using a very small size of acs simulations based on synthetic data and phantom experiments show that the new method can achieve higher actual acceleration factors with improved reconstruction quality comparing to existing k domain methods this work is partly developed from previous work 17 materials and methodsthe basic idea of the method is that for data acquired in pi with large arrays the skipped phase encoding data can be recovered using a sinc interpolation then a final reconstruction can be achieved by combining the images from all channels following the nyquist sampling requirement k space sampling interval is determined by desired overall field of view fov down sampling with an interval larger than the nyquist interval can lead to aliasing image artifact in pi this limit is overcome by the parallel acquisition from channels with different spatial sensitivities specifically it is assumed that individual coil s maximum fovc is much smaller than the overall fov due to its localized sensitivity then larger sampling intervals are acceptable in the shrunk direction of fovc consider a 3d pi case where data is acquired on a cartesian grid with accelerations in two phase encoding dimensions in the proposed method k space data of a single channel can be recovered by 18 1 where m 1 2 m n 1 2 n are the indices of the recovered signal p d1 2d1 m and q d2 2d2 n are the indices of the acquired data s with acceleration factors d1 and d2 along the two dimensions xo yo is the center of a reconstruction rectangular window of sizethat covers the area of individual channel image content this formula uses all acquired k space data and only one phase term is unknown eq 1 is for 3d imaging with two accelerated phase encoding directions where signals along both dimensions are down sampled for 2d imaging or coils with localized sensitivity in only one direction eq 1 can be simplified to a 1d sinc interpolation an accurate recovery based on this formula requires an estimate of xo yo note that this center is equivalent to the center of optimal pilars reconstruction window rather than coil center the estimation cannot be obtained from the k space data acquired with accelerations alone to find an optimal xo yo a few acs data are acquired in principle the number of acs data points can be as small as two which are sufficient for estimating the parameters in eq 1 in this article a two stage phase calibration method is introduced to estimate the parameters which is described next two stage phase calibrationto estimate unknown parameter xo yo the algorithm first finds an approximate center afterward xo yo is searched in the vicinity of in practice the approximate coil center is located from a profile of the channel image which is obtained by inverse fourier transform of the zero padded k space data with acs because the higher energy contained in these low frequency harmonics in acs are not folded the corresponding channel profile will not be folded and the coil location can be identified directly a one dimensional 1d example is shown in fig 1 the approximate centeris found at the maximal intensity location along each dimension note that in this stage only a rough guess is required figure 1open in figure viewerpowerpointprofile of the channel image and localization of optimal center region shadowed the profile is obtained from a central k space line along the horizontal dimension the maximum of the profile is taken as an initial estimate color figure can be viewed in the online issue which is available at wileyonlinelibrary com in the second stage the optimal window center xo yo is chosen by minimizing the error metric based on the acs i e 2 where sacs is the acquired acs data andis the interpolated acs data at the same location using eq 1 with parameter xo yo the minimization is done by exhaustive search the computation load is low because both the size of acs and the number of parameters are small reconstruction procedureafter the two stage phase calibration is performed for each channel eq 1 is used to interpolate missing k space data from the acquired data channel image is then obtained through inverse fourier transforming the whole k space data that includes both the acquired and the interpolated data a complete single channel reconstruction process is shown in fig 2 after all channel images are reconstructed the final image is obtained using the root of sum of squares method figure 2open in figure viewerpowerpointreconstruction process of a single channel in the proposed pilars method

using the proposed pilars method the mcmli reconstruction and the conventional pils method acs data in the central k space with a size of 5 5 28 28 were used for pilars and mcmli respectively the pils method requires an estimate of coil center which should be the maximum amplitude location of the gaussian sensitivity function in this case the pulsar 19 toolbox was used to perform the pils reconstruction the mcmli method used a reconstruction kernel of size 2 2 36 fe pe coil reconstruction of the fully sampled data using the sum of squares method was used as standard reference reconstruction errors were calculated as normalized root mean square error nrmse the actual acceleration factor is defined as the ratio of size of fully sampled data to size of actual acquired data 3 where nacs is the size of acs and m n is the number of two phase encodings respectively for a more robust calibration acs of larger size can be used at the cost of a lower actual acceleration factor in addition a set of fully sampled 256 256 data was acquired on a 4 7t small bore system using a 64 channel receive coil array accelerations were simulated by retrospective decimation of the full dataset because the array coils were localized only along the horizontal dimension acceleration was applied only along that dimension d1 1 reconstructions using the proposed pilars method the mcmli method and the pils method with various acceleration factors were performed and compared a reconstruction kernel of 2 3 3 7 was used in the mcmli reconstruction and 32 pe lines were used as acs because it is around the minimum number required for an outer acceleration factor of d2 10 with the given kernel size for the pilars method acs sizes from 2 to 16 were tested reconstruction errors were measured using the sum of squares of full size data as a reference the actual acceleration factors reconstruction errors and the reconstruction time were compared for different methods all the simulations were performed on a 2 6ghz dual core cpu with 2 gb memory in matlab math works natick ma resultscoil sensitivities of the first 24 channels in the 36 ch simulated system are shown on the right side of fig 3 for pilars method the optimal window center from the two stage estimation was obtained for each channel and shown as dots on corresponding sensitivity map note that the pilars optimal center differs from the true coil center which is the position with maximum amplitude of the gaussian sensitivity the reconstructed images and the corresponding error images are shown in fig 4 the actual acceleration factors of the three methods are shown on corresponding reconstructions from the error images and the nrmse one can see that the pilars method yielded less reconstruction error in the mcmli reconstruction the errors appear to be more diffused but its actual acceleration factor is smaller as shown the pilars method achieved an actual acceleration factor very close to d1d2 as in the pils method the mcmli method resulted in a smaller actual acceleration factors because it requires a larger acs size figure 4open in figure viewerpowerpointreconstructions from simulated k

outer acceleration factor of 3 5 and 10 from the real 64 ch data with 1d acceleration are shown in fig 5 the actual acceleration factors are shown on corresponding reconstructions the pilars method can achieve a similar error level with less acquired data comparing to the mcmli method the pils reconstructions have the largest nrmse the pilars and the mcmli methods are also implemented with an outer acceleration factor of 3 but with different acs size the results are shown in table 1 the nrmse of pilars is much lower than that of the mcmli method with the same acs size in addition pilars is

discussion and conclusionsthe pils method is a well known pi reconstruction method for highly localized arrays which is essentially a cut and paste technique after coil centers are determined the proposed pilars method is different from the pils method in several aspects first pilars does not require the knowledge of the accurate location of the coil element to reconstruct image correctly as shown in the simulated study the sinc windowing center can differ from the true coil center as it is determined by both channel sensitivity and object being imaged second as in grappa or mcmli pilars can incorporate the acs in the final reconstruction which results in improved image quality finally as the final step in the reconstruction involves sum of squares of all channel images some snr benefit can be expected similar to grappa and mcmli an interesting observation from our results is that the optimal pilars truncation window centers in the sense of minimal error in eq 2 can differ from the coil sensitivity centers as used in pils in both methods the center is used to define the location of a truncation window in pils it is the coil sensitivity center in pilars it is estimated from acquired data using eq 2 which embeds both the coil sensitivity and the underlying image object for example fig 3 shows that the estimated centers are shifted toward the center of the phantom image this adjustment leads to less power of folded artifacts in the reduced fov as a result pilars yields more accurate reconstructions we also inspected the phase map of reconstructions our general observation is that when the coil image is localized the pilars can reconstruct phase information faithfully otherwise the phase map of pilars reconstruction is less accurate than the mcmli even though its magnitude reconstructions have less nrmse in addition nrmse or artifact power is not necessary for an accurate or optimal metric to measure artifacts as it only accounts for the total energy but not the structures of the artifacts several limitations exist for the proposed method as in many other interpolation methods errors can be higher at the boundary in the k space because only partial sinc function coefficients are available in the boundary areas in addition the method is limited to arrays with highly localized elements in the imaging plane relative to the acceleration factors for less localized coils or at deeper image planes where the coil sensitivity spreads the acceleration factors will significantly reduce a potential quantitative measure of coil locality can be defined as the ratio between the coil sensitivity energy within the reduced fov corresponding to the given acceleration factor and the total coil sensitivity energy a user defined threshold can be applied on the ratio to determine whether the coils are localized enough for a given acceleration factor this article introduced a new pi reconstruction method which is termed as pilars the method is useful for pi with highly localized coil sensitivities such as the large arrays the reconstruction formula in the proposed method uses a sinc kernel with predetermined interpolation coefficients and uses all acquired k space data a two stage algorithm is described to determine the phase parameter needed in the interpolation computer simulations on both synthetic data and real mri experiment dataset showed that the new method could achieve higher actual acceleration factors with improved reconstruction quality acknowledgementsthe authors thank steven m wright and mary p mcdougall at texas

prevalence of each subtype among hcv isolates in chiang mai thailand was determined hcv 3a appeared to be the most common subtype in blood donors and was also frequently found in patients with liver disease hcv 1b but not hcv 2a or 2b was also commonly found in this area while a considerable percentage of the total hcv isolates still remained unclassifiable by the above methods serotype analysis of the hcv isolates using c14 1 and c14 2 recombinant peptides revealed that hcv 3a was likely to carry an antigenic determinant s different from those of the major types 1 hcv 1a and 1b and 2 hcv 2a

transfer learning algorithm to classify motor imagery eeg data by analyzing the power spectrum of eeg data related to motor imagery the shared features across sessions or across subjects namely the mean and variance of model parameters are extracted then select the data sets that were most relevant to the new data set according to euclidean distance to update the shared features finally utilize the shared features and subject session specific features jointly to generate a new model we evaluated our algorithm by analyzing the motor imagery eeg data from 10 healthy participants and a public data set from bci competition iv the classification accuracy of the proposed transfer learning is higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms the results of the paired t test showed that the classification results of psd and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different p 2 0946e 9 and the classification results of csp and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different p 1 9122e 6 the test accuracy of data set 2a of bci competition iv was 85 7 5 4 which was higher than that of related traditional machine learning algorithms preliminary results suggested that the proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to the classification of motor imagery eeg signals across sessions and across subjects and the performance is better than that of the traditional machine learning algorithms it can be promising to be applied to the field of brain computer interface bci graphical abstractthis is a preview of subscription content log in to

synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase that catalyzes the specific formation from c5 units of the respective c10 c15 and c20 precursors of monoterpenes sesquiterpenes and diterpenes unlike farnesyl diphosphate synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase which are homodimers geranyl diphosphate synthase from mentha is a heterotetramer in which the large subunit shares functional motifs and a high level of amino acid sequence identity 56 75 with geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases of plant origin the small subunit however shares little sequence identity with other isoprenyl diphosphate synthases yet it is absolutely required for geranyl diphosphate synthase catalysis coexpression in escherichia coli of the mentha geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit with the phylogenetically distant geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases from taxus canadensis and abies grandis yielded a functional hybrid heterodimer that generated geranyl diphosphate as product in each case these results indicate that the geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit is capable of modifying the chain length specificity of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase but not apparently farnesyl diphosphate synthase to favor the production of c10 chains comparison of the kinetic behavior of the parent prenyltransferases with that of the hybrid enzyme revealed that the hybrid possesses

the small subunit lacks the aspartate rich functional motifs and is alone inactive it was hypothesized that the small subunit may bind to and modify the otherwise inactive large subunit to promote transfer catalysis while restricting chain length elongation specifically to the c10product if the gpps ssu plays such a role then it also seemed possible that the small subunit might be capable of

parent ggpps homodimer this second example confirmed the ability of the gpps small subunit to modify the specificity of ggpps for production of the shorter prenyl chain to determine whether gpps ssu

product formed in all instances was fpp data not shown these data indicated that although gpps ssu his and fpps were successfully coexpressed no interaction between the two occurred that was sufficient to permit isolation of an associated species or to promote a detectable alteration in product formation by fpps discussionthe observation that mentha geranyl diphosphate synthase is composed of a large subunit that resembles geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and a small subunit that does not resemble any known prenyltransferase suggested a role for the small subunit in interacting with the prenyltransferase like large subunit to promote catalysis while restricting the reaction to a single condensation cycle with dmapp and ipp to produce specifically geranyl diphosphate to determine whether the small subunit could interact with other prenyltransferases to influence product distribution a strategy was developed that employed a histidine tagged version of the gpps small subunit to permit affinity based purification of this subunit along with any associated protein this approach was tested with the ggpps from taxus which bears the least resemblance of any extant ggpps to the mentha gpps large subunit following coexpression the resulting chimeric prenyltransferase was purified and shown to synthesize primarily gpp with competent kinetics these results which were confirmed with the ggpps from a grandis clearly demonstrate that the small subunit of gpps is capable of binding to and modifying ggpps to promote the efficient production of gpp by compromising the subsequent elongation steps to fpp and ggpp the physical basis of subunit interactions that underlies this catalytic alteration is unknown and is presently under investigation because the small subunit lacks the aspartate rich motifs associated with prenyltransferase chemistry a direct role in catalysis seems unlikely but rather suggests that the small subunit serves to bind to and constrict the ggpps active site cavity thereby restricting the ability to conduct elongation beyond the c10 stage comparing hydropathy plots for gpps ssu gpps lsu fpps and ggpps reveals only that these proteins have similar profiles and modeling against existing crystal structures of prenyltransferases provides no guidance as to how gpps ssu modifies the active site of its bound partner both monoterpene biosynthesis and diterpene biosynthesis are localized in plastids of higher plants and both gpps and ggpps are plastid targeted because diterpene biosynthesis is considered to evolutionarily predate monoterpene biosynthesis 44trapp s c croteau r b genetics 2001 158 811 832pubmedgoogle scholar it seems plausible that a means for supply of gpp for monoterpene biosynthesis could have evolved by modification of ggpp synthase involving the interaction with another protein i e the small subunit both gpps and ggpps operate in the same subcellular locale and utilize the same precursor pools of ipp and dmapp thus the derivation of gpp and ggpp by functionally very different enzymes may be of regulatory significance in the control of precursor flux toward monoterpene or diterpene biosynthesis because there are few prenyltransferases that appear capable of synthesizing multiple products of different chain lengths 1ogura k koyama t chem rev 1998 98 1263 1276crossrefpubmedscopus 237 google scholar evolution appears to disfavor this approach to controlling supply of precursors for the synthesis of the different terpenoid families the fact that gpps is heteromeric both dimer and tetramer are active is suggestive of functional regulation although possible bases of such control by allosterism or dissociation are presently unknown it is of interest in this connection to note that some mammalian ggpp synthases appear to possess tetrameric architecture 45sagami h morita y ogura k j biol chem 1994 269 20561 20566abstractfull text pdfpubmedgoogle

association of the two proteins or any catalytic alteration in this case the failure of the gpps small subunit to interact with fpps may also have evolutionary origins of regulatory significance thus fpps operates in the cytosol to provide precursor for sesquiterpene and triterpene biosynthesis and there is no specific requirement for gpp production at this locale therefore there is no functional utility for the interaction of the gpps small subunit and fpps and any interaction of the two would appear to be counterproductive during the period of transit of the small subunit from cytosol to

daytime cognitive function mood and sleepiness however its efficacy has not been validated by controlled trials we have carried out a randomised placebo controlled crossover study of objective daytime sleepiness symptoms cognitive function and mood in a consecutive series of 32 sahs patients with a median apnoea plus hypopnoea frequency of 28 range 7 129 per hour slept patients were treated with 4 weeks each of cpap and an oral placebo which they were told might improve upper airway muscle function during sleep assessments on the last day of each treatment included a multiple sleep latency test and tests of symptom scores mood profiles and cognitive performance the patients had significantly less daytime sleepiness on cpap than during the placebo period mean sleep latency 7 2 se 0 7 vs 6 1 0

In human brain, T(2) values for singlets such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline have been reported, but few T(2) values are available for J-coupled spin systems. The purpose of this study was to measure the T(2) relaxation times of J-coupled metabolites in the human occipital lobe using the LASER sequence. Spectra were acquired at multiple echo times and were analyzed with an LCModel using basis sets simulated at each echo time. Separate basis spectra were used for resonances of protons belonging to the same molecule but having very different T(2) values (e.g., two separate basis spectra were used for the singlet and multiplet signal in N-acetylaspartate). The T(2) values for the N-acetylaspartate multiplet (149 ± 12 ms), glutamate (125 ± 10 ms), myo-inositol (139 ± 20 ms), and taurine (196 ± 28 ms) were successfully measured in the human visual cortex at 4 T. These measured T(2) relaxation times have enabled the accurate and absolute quantification of cerebral metabolites at longer echo times.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

In clinical practice, however, low contrast features such as subtle lesions are often of equal or greater interest. Using an American College of Radiology MR quality assurance phantom and test, we describe a novel framework for systematically and automatically evaluating the low-contrast object detectability performance of different undersampled image reconstruction methods. This platform is used to evaluate three such methods, two based on classic Tikhonov regularization and one sparsity-driven method based on ℓ(1) -norm minimization (which is commonly used in compressive sensing, also known as compressed sensing, applications), across a wide range of sampling rates and parameterizations. Both the automated evaluation system and a manual evaluation of anatomical images with numerically-generated low contrast inserts demonstrate that sparse reconstructions exhibit superior low-contrast object detectability performance compared to both Tikhonov-regularized reconstructions. The implications of this result, and potential applications of both the described low-contrast object detectability platform and generalizations of it are then discussed.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

This analysis included 956 women with 1835 deliveries, who completed a study questionnaire at 6-11 years (median [interquartile range]: 8.1 [7.1, 9.8]) after their first delivery.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Exclusion criteria regarding the first birth were: maternal age <15 or >50 years, delivery at <37 weeks gestation, placenta previa, multiple gestation, known fetal congenital abnormality, stillbirth, prior myomectomy and abruption. Of the 956 women included, the first delivery was by Cesarean section for 534 women and by vaginal birth for 422 women. Infertility was self-reported. To compare maternal characteristics by mode of first delivery, P-values were calculated using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ(2) test for categorical variables and a Kruskall-Wallis test for continuous variables. We also considered whether, across all deliveries to date, a prior Cesarean is associated with decreased fertility. In this analysis, self-reported infertility after each delivery (across all participants) was considered as a function of one or more prior Cesarean births, using generalized estimating equations to control for within-woman correlation.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: No differences were observed between the Cesarean and vaginal groups (for first delivery) with respect to infertility after their most recent delivery (7 versus 6%, P = 0.597), the interval between their first and second births (30.8 versus 30.6 months, P = 0.872), or multiparity (75 versus 76%, P = 0.650). Across all births, a history of Cesarean delivery was not significantly associated with infertility (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.26). Women who reported infertility prior to their first delivery were significantly more likely to report infertility after each subsequent delivery (OR, 5.16; 95% CI, 3.60-7.39).\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Due to the use of self-reported infertility, the fertility status of some participants may be misclassified. Also, the small sample size may result in insufficient power to detect small differences between groups. Finally, a relatively high proportion of our participants were over age 35 at the time of first delivery (26%) and highly educated (37% with graduate degrees), which may indicate that our population may not be generalizable.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: While some prior studies have shown decreased family size among women who deliver by Cesarean, our results suggest that the rate of infertility is not different after Cesarean compared with vaginal birth. Our findings should be reassuring to women who deliver by Cesarean section.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This study was funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH, R01-HD056275). No competing interests are declared.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

mangrove suggests some non fecal pollution or other habitat alteration key words kluyveromyces aestuarii mangroves environmental indicator estuaries have more yeast cells per volume and also greater richness of species than adjacent aquatic areas 10 28 some yeasts have been isolated mostly from these environments especially in mangrove forests of tropical and subtropical estuaries and temperate salt marshes scheffersomyces spartinae has been reported under the name pichia spartinae from southeastern u s salt marshes and associated with the marsh grass spartina alterniflora 2 9 20 21 and various new species including some in the saccharomyces clade have been described recently from mangroves confirming the yeast species richness of this biome 4 5 13 19 yeasts of the genus kluyveromyces have been found frequently in these environments kluyveromyces lactis syn k drosophilarum has been found in large populations in estuarine sediments in louisiania and salt marches in georgia u s a 9 20 kluyveromyces lactis strains that were found in estuarine salt marsh environments by meyers and colleagues 20 produced more pulcherriminic acid than the type strain of the same species suggesting that this species plays an ecological role in iron cycle in estuaries kluyveromyces aestuarii also produces this pigment in its ascospores and can often be noted on isolation plates by the pink to deep ochre color frequently formed in colonies 18 yeasts in mangrove ecosystems may play an important role in the detrital food web in that they may be a food source for some marine invertebrates and zooplankton species 23 kluyveromyces aestuarii has been considered a marine yeast 18 and although frequently isolated from mangroves this species is rare in other habitats including temperate estuaries and salt marches 10 16 20 am in et al 4 described kluyveromyces siamensis as sibling species isolated from water in a mangrove forest in ranong province thailand however this species is only marginally separated from k aestuarii based on the d1 d2 region partial rdna sequence and there may reason to doubt its validity as an ecological species because of the similarity in habitat and phenotypic characteristics although the genus kluyveromyces is more known to be associated with forest substrates and insect vectors like drosophila kluyveromyces nonfermentans has been described based on isolates from deep sea habitats 22 so the genus is clearly present also in marine habitats first described as saccharomyces aestuarii based on a culture isolated by j w fell from sediments of biscayne bay in miami florida 11 12 k aestuarii was then isolated 14 times from marine but not fresh water sites in the florida everglades by ahearn and colleagues 1 14 araujo et al 6 and soares et al 26 observed very high levels of yeast species diversity in a mangrove in rio de janeiro but k aestuarii was the prevalent species a study of the yeast community in the coroa grande mangrove in rio de janeiro found k aestuarii as the prevalent species associated especially with detritivores animals but not herbivores and carnivores 6 and with sediments directly under mangrove vegetation 26 there is no published data on yeast community structure of mangroves from other continents but some isolates of k aestuarii from australia and asia have been deposited in culture collections showing that distribution is not limited to the americas http www cbs knaw nl yeast biolomics aspx http www nbrc nite go jp nbrc2 nbrccataloguedetailservlet id nbrc cat 00010952 our objective in this work was to see if k aestuarii was consistently present in different mangrove areas in rio de janeiro to support that it has potential as an indicator of environmental quality of

2008 and 2009 and at site 46 in march from 2001 through 2004 2008 and 2009 the other sites were sampled between october 1995 and june of 1997 samples of 100 to 500 cm3 of the upper 5 cm layer of sediment were collected aseptically with a sterilize spatula placed in sterile bottles and returned to the laboratory on wet ice to be processed 25 26 sub samples of 5g from each well mixed sediment sample were diluted in 2 volumes of sterile 0 85 nacl and agitated vigorously for 30 seconds aliquots of 0 1ml and serial dilutions of these suspensions were inoculated on ym agar yeast extract 0 3 malt extract 0 3 peptone 0 5 glucose 1 agar 2 and chloramphenicol 100 mg an aliquot of 1ml from each sample was also inoculated into tubes of a selective broth containing sodium propionate 0 1 lactose

using the taxonomic keys of kurtzman and fell 17 amplification of its region of rdna of some strains was carried out in order to confirm similarity of the cultures 27 and some of the k aestuarii from coroa grande were deposited in the cbs collection and their identifications confirmed by rdna partial sequences cbs 7767 7768 7775 7776 http www cbs knaw nl yeast biolomics aspx consulted on oct 30 2010 presumptive thermotolerant coliforms counts were determined by the apha standard 3 tube mpn test 3 from a total of 61 samples from mangrove sediments 22 yielded 1 or more cultures of k aestuarii table 1 some of our k aestuarii isolates were different from the standard description in the assimilation of sorbose and xylose but this was also observed previously by soares et al 26 and these abilities were noted in the original description of the species so they may have been lost during storage in culture collections 6 11 26 kluyveromyces aestuarii was isolated from all mangrove sites studied except for the catal o point site 46 on ilha do fund o in spite of being the most extensive sampling with 19 taken from it between 2001 and 2009 the highest frequencies of this species were in bracu ii and jabaquara ii sites within the mangrove vegetation areas but without extensive anthropic impact the lowest frequency was from the bracu i estuary site where there was a construction project in progress that was perturbing the sediments and ilha do fund o site 46 which has heavy pollution from drift material the site with the highest coliform level had a high frequency of k aestuarii isolations so fecal pollution is apparently not an important factor in distribution of the species in previous studies of dark mangrove mud from sites not directly associated with mangrove vegetation this species was not isolated 24 26 but from the same region in sepetiba bay it had been found previously to be the prevalent yeast species from samples taken within sediments under mangrove vegetation of coroa grande 6 26 however k aestuarii was found in only 2 of 5 sediment samples and none in the mangrove mussels sampled in 1995 and 1996 from coroa grande 7 8 a flood caused by torrential rains in coroa grande could have influenced the mangrove biota including the yeast community associated with sediments during 1996 the role of this species in mangrove ecosystems is still not clear but it appears to be associated with degrading leaves within the mangrove vegetation areas this yeast was found in detritus feeding invertebrates and sediments within the mangrove vegetation area but was not common in invertebrates feeding on fresh leaves or other animals or in the sediments of a tide flat bordering on but not covered by mangrove vegetation 6 26 there were changes in the dominance of this species over time at coroa grande but it was generally more frequent in the more marine influenced sites and this in agreement with it being considered a marine organism other factors appear to be involved in its distribution although k aestuarii was present in all the other mangrove sites especially those with stronger marine influence it was conspicuously absent in 19 samples taken over a decade from the ilha do fund o catal o beach site 46 this site is directly exposed to seawater in guanabara bay and always had a thick layer of plastic bags deposited in the top few cm layer of mud that had to be removed to get sediment samples from the intertidal zone coliform levels at site 46 were typically close to the limits of bathing quality standards and salinity close to that of seawater although the location is within an otherwise heavily polluted urban area impact from the plastic bag pollution at catal o beach site 46 and from alterations of the sediments due to flooding at coroa grande and construction at bracu i may have inhibited populations of this otherwise typical mangrove yeast santos and colleagues 25 have suggested the use of microeukaryotes detected by noncultivation methods as environmental quality indicators and hagler 15 has indicated previously that k aestuarii could serve as an indicator for mangroves our data suggests the species could be used in environmental quality monitoring of mangroves for factors other than recent fecal contamination this could be made more practical by using more selective cultivation methods as suggested by hagler 15 or non cultivation pcr based methods employing a specific primer as suggested recently by santos et al 25 clearly the presence of k aestuarii in other habitats suggests influence from a mangrove habitat and the absence in the site heavily impacted by plastic bags suggests that this kind of pollution does affect the microbial communities of mangrove sediments

After replication, the newly synthesized DNA is rapidly assembled into chromatin. The newly assembled chromatin 'matures' and adopts a variety of different conformations. This differential packaging of DNA plays an important role for the maintenance of gene expression patterns and has to be reliably copied in each cell division. Posttranslational histone modifications are prime candidates for the regulation of the chromatin structure. In order to understand the maintenance of chromatin structures, it is crucial to understand the replication of histone modification patterns. To study the kinetics of histone modifications in vivo, we have pulse-labeled synchronized cells with an isotopically labeled arginine ((15)N(4)) that is 4 Da heavier than the naturally occurring (14)N(4) isoform. As most of the histone synthesis is coupled with replication, the cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary, released into S-phase and simultaneously incubated in the medium containing heavy arginine, thus labeling all newly synthesized proteins. This method allows a comparison of modification patterns on parental versus newly deposited histones.

Expression of tceA increased 40-fold after chlorinated ethene-starved cells were exposed to trichloroethene (TCE), cis-dichloroethene (DCE), or 1,1-DCE but did not increase after exposure to tetrachloroethene or vinyl chloride. Surprisingly, tceA expression also increased 30-fold after cellular exposure to the nonmetabolic substrate trans-DCE, indicating that expression of tceA is induced by both growth-supporting and non-growth-supporting chlorinated ethenes. Additional experiments revealed that the level of tceA expression was independent of the concentration of chlorinated ethenes (sum concentrations of TCE and DCEs of 2.2 to 333 microM), the concentration of the electron donor hydrogen (concentrations of 12 nM to 17 microM), and the presence of alternate bacterial electron acceptors (5 mM concentrations of fumarate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, nitrate, or nitrite) but was highly dependent on incubation temperature.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

Dephasing under nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to predict key features of the nonlinear evolution.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

This nonuniform sampling can be problematic, especially in image segmentation and clinical examination. To alleviate this, the acquisition is divided into (two or) three separate scans, with higher in-plane resolutions and thick slices, yet orthogonal slice-selection directions. In this work, a noniterative wavelet-based approach for combining the three orthogonal scans is adopted, and its advantages compared with other existing methods, such as Fourier techniques, are discussed, including the consideration of the actual pulse response of the MRI scanner, and its lower computational complexity. Experimental results are shown on simulated and real 7 T MRI data.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

metrics abstractin briefbackground the combination of 2 chloroprocaine and bupivacaine c b for regional anesthesia has been described but its use was largely abandoned due to equivocal results in efficacy in this prospective double blind randomized study we compared the onset of an interscalene block using c b versus a combination of lidocaine and bupivacaine l b methods thirty patients scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy under interscalene block were divided into two groups of 15 each one group c b received 3 2 chloroprocaine combined with bicarbonate and epinephrine immediately followed by 0 5 bupivacaine and epinephrine whereas the other group l b received 2 lidocaine instead of 3 2 chloroprocaine motor and sensory block were assessed every 15 s the primary end point was the time of onset to complete motor block time to event survival statistical analysis tests were applied results one l b patient had a failed block and was excluded the median time to motor block for c b and l b was 90 15 575 and 180 15 3720 s respectively p 0 0325 and to sensory block for c b and l b was 90 30 600 and 210 30 3900 s respectively p 0 0185 survival analysis showed that in 5 min 13 of 15 patients from the c b group but only 7 of 14 from the l b group had a successful motor block in 10 min 15 of 15 patients from the c b group but only 10 of 14 from the l b group had a successful motor block it took as long as 60 min to assess block success failure for blocks in the l b group conclusions this study demonstrates that a successful block was more rapid using c b than l b for interscalene blocks implications a 2 chloroprocaine bupivacaine combination provides a faster onset motor and sensory interscalene block than that produced by a lidocaine bupivacaine combination both combinations offer adequate intraoperative anesthesia the local anesthetic used during regional blockade should ideally have a rapid onset and long duration of action to provide both of these properties combinations of local anesthetics have been used 1 32 chloroprocaine in various combinations was studied in the 1970s and early 1980s4 11 with equivocal results a study by cunningham and kaplan6 showed a significant decrease in onset time of axillary block without reducing the duration of block when 2 chloroprocaine was mixed with bupivacaine the study by cohen and thurlow9 in 1979 reported that mixing the two local anesthetics for epidural anesthesia produced a block similar to that produced by 2 chloroprocaine alone galindo and witcher 10 in 1980 demonstrated that the recovery of block from a mixture of bupivacaine and 2 chloroprocaine was significantly prolonged if the ph of the mixture was more alkaline 10 the study by corke and carlson11 in 1984 suggested that hydrolysis of 2 chloroprocaine by plasma esterases produces the metabolite 4 amino 2 chlorobenzoic acid which interferes with the binding or access of bupivacaine to its site of action because of the unfavorable results in some studies the use of a chloroprocaine and bupivacaine combination has been largely abandoned we anecdotally noted that sequential administration of bicarbonated 2 chloroprocaine and bupivacaine was successful in producing surgical anesthesia for upper extremity surgery as a result we conducted this prospective double blind randomized study comparing sequentially administered bicarbonated 2 chloroprocaine and bupivacaine with bicarbonated l b methodsafter irb approval written informed consent was obtained from 30 asa physical status i or ii patients scheduled to undergo elective shoulder arthroscopy patients were randomized using a computer generated randomization table to either the 2 chloroprocaine bupivacaine c b group or the lidocaine bupivacaine l b group exclusion criteria were the presence of any neurological deficits in the upper extremity history of allergy to local anesthetics the presence of infection at the site of block and hemostatic disorders none of the patients reported a history of pseudocholinesterase deficiency patients with failed block were excluded from data analysis the blocks were performed by only one skilled and experienced anesthesiologist sj and were facilitated by sedation with iv midazolam with or without small amounts of propofol supplemental analgesics fentanyl intraoperatively and percocet postoperatively were given to any patient who experienced any discomfort not related to the surgical site low back pain leg pain etc all patients received a standard single injection interscalene block using the winnie approach a 50 mm 22 gauge insulated needle b braun mcgaw medical bethlehem pa attached to a nerve stimulator was used to identify the brachial plexus placement of the needle was considered adequate if the deltoid muscle motor response was still present at 0 3 milliamps the study drug solutions were prepared by one anesthesiologist who was not directly involved with the administration of the anesthetics or evaluation of the blocks each solution was prepared in a separate syringe and they were not mixed before or during administration patients received 20 ml of either the 2 chloroprocaine or the lidocaine solution according to their randomization followed shortly by 20 ml of the bupivacaine solution as follows c b group 20 ml of the following 3 2 chloroprocaine 18 ml epinephrine 50 g 8

20 ml epinephrine 50 g the needle extension tubing was connected to the syringes of local anesthetic via a three way stopcock after localization of the brachial plexus and negative aspiration the fast acting local anesthetic either 2 chloroprocaine or lidocaine was injected in increments of 5 ml with aspiration after each incremental injection this was followed by the bupivacaine injection after a short pause the two injections were completed within approximately 90 s upper extremity motor and sensory blocks were assessed every 15 s after the block was administered the primary end point for the study was the occurrence of complete motor block of the upper extremity we calculated the duration between the needle withdrawal and the time to establish complete motor block tmotor the motor block was considered complete when the patient was unable to lift his her arm from the table against gravity a secondary end point for evaluation was the time to establish sensory block tsensory we calculated the duration between the needle withdrawal and the time to establish sensory block the sensory block was assessed by a standard pinprick in c5 c6 dermatomes for uniformity of assessment by the researcher the sensory block was considered complete when the patient was unable to feel the pinprick in the entire surgical territory establishing a complete surgical anesthesia motor and sensory block were assessed until a successful block was demonstrated again at the end of surgery and once again immediately before discharge pain scores and analgesic usage if applicable were also assessed and documented during the operation and in the postanesthesia care unit pacu immediately before discharge from the pacu patients were asked to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the anesthetic technique using a scale from 1 to 3 in which 1 meant not satisfied 2 satisfied and 3 extremely satisfied patients were asked if they would have the block should they need the same operation again since patients were discharged home before recovery from the anesthetic patients were asked to document the time of the first occurrence of discomfort after discharge patients were contacted a day after discharge to collect data about recovery from the block but due to unreliability of the data and lack of exact time when recovery occured in the majority of cases the results were not included in the current study patients were given prescriptions for ibuprofen and vicodin as needed statistical analysisthis was a time to event study the statistical analysis was performed using stata version 8 2 the primary end point of the study was the development of motor block tmotor and the secondary end point was the development of sensory block tsensory in c b and l b groups the sample size was determined using the comparison between proportions of patients who had the event motor block occur at a prespecified time point 3 min in our study an earlier pilot study at new york methodist hospital showed that by the end of 3 min 80 of patients who received the c b combination had a motor block a review of historical data from new york methodist hospital showed that at 3 min only 15 of patients who received the l b combination had a motor block based on these data 28 patients 14 patients in each group were required to test the null hypothesis that the time to motor block is equal in both groups with a significance level of 0 05 2 sided test and a power of 80 however the sample size was adjusted to 30 15 in each group to allow for a one case of block failure in each group numerical data i e tmotor tsensory age height and weight are expressed as mean standard deviation or median range categorical data gender are addressed as frequencies numerical data that are of the time to event or survival type i e tmotor tsensory were analyzed using kaplan meier estimates and kaplan meier plots log rank tests were conducted to compare between the two groups p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant resultsthere were no significant demographic differences between the two groups table 1 of the 30 patients one patient in the l b group had an inadequate sensory and motor block and required conversion to general anesthesia after the operation the patient was rechecked and no motor or sensory block was present this patient was dropped from the data analysis all other patients in both groups had a complete sensory and motor block throughout the operation and continuing through discharge from the pacu any variation in the duration of block was not clinically significant as all patients continued to have motor and sensory blocks until they were discharged home table 1 patients demographicsno patient reported pain at the site of surgery during the operation four patients received supplemental analgesics for nonsurgical site discomfort one patient in the c b group received 200 mcg fentanyl three patients in the l b group received 100 150 and 200 mcg fentanyl respectively one patient in the c b group received one percocet tablet in the pacu for discomfort all patients were discharged home on the same day of surgery sixteen patients rated their anesthetic as satisfied and 13 as extremely satisfied there was no significant difference in satisfaction scores between the two groups all the patients answered that they would have the block should they need the same operation again there were no short term complications such as intravascular injection neuraxial block or local anesthetic toxicity patients were not examined specifically for long term neurologic complications but no neurologic complications were subsequently reported by the surgeons all patients were discharged home from the pacu in stable condition table 2 shows that there was a statically significant difference in median onset times between tmotor and tsensory with group c b median onset times being at least half of group l b the log rank test results that compare the time to motor and sensory block in both groups are also given table 2 onset to sensory and motor blockusing the kaplan meier estimate at 5 min a successful motor block was present in 13 of 15 patients in the c b group but in only 8 of 14 from the l b group fig 1 similarly at 5 min 13 of 15 patients in the c b group had a successful sensory block compared with 8 of 14 from the l b group fig 2 at 10 min all patients 15 of 15 in the c b group had both a successful motor block and a successful sensory block at 10 min only 10 of 14 patients in the l b group had a successful motor block and a successful sensory block it would take as much as 60 min for all patients in the l b group to have a successful motor block and a successful sensory block figure 1 time to motor block kaplan

block kaplan meier curves showing the time to event probability y axis versus the time to sensory block t sensory in seconds for 2 chloroprocaine bupivacaine c b and lidocaine bupivacaine l b based on the analysis of the study data using kaplan meier estimates with a 95 confidence interval if interscalene block were performed on 1000 patients using the c b medications all of the patients would have a successful motor blocks by 10 min on the other hand if an interscalene block were performed on 1000 patients using the l b medications only 714 476 912 and 929 725 996 patients would have a successful motor block by 10 and 20 min respectively this difference is statistically significant with p 0 05 discussionin the present study we demonstrated that a c b combination consistently resulted in faster onset times for interscalene block than l b c b combination was abandoned by most clinicians by the early 1980s because it did not seem to work in the epidural space however we demonstrated that the c b block was effective in the interscalene approach to the brachial plexus the c b block was equally effective as l b in the brachial plexus block in terms of duration until discharge and requirements for intraoperative analgesic supplementation the incongruity between our results and previous results may have a number of causes the epidural space and the area near the brachial plexus may have different characteristics as to vascular absorption and esterase hydrolysis this is consistent with the results of cunningham and kaplan 6 who had success with the c b combination in an axillary block minimizing differences in ph by adding bicarbonate to both the lidocaine and 2 chloroprocaine solutions may also have played a role both local anesthetic combinations on average provide rapid onset of surgical anesthesia when the c b combination was used the demonstration of a successful block was more rapid than when the l b combination was used based on survival analysis of the data if the c b combination is used and a block has not developed within 10 min then it can be concluded that no block will develop later on the other hand survival analysis shows that 10 min is not enough time to exclude the success of a l b block initially unsuccessful l b blocks may become successful blocks for some time after placement it takes up to 60 min to conclude that the l b block is unsuccessful the use of c b in place of l b permits a more rapid decision to abandon an unsuccessful block with a potential positive influence on operating room utilization and economic efficiency study limitationswe chose the time to onset of motor block rather than sensory block as the primary end point despite the clinical importance of the sensory block in the practice of anesthesia this was because of the objective nature of assessing motor block as compared with the subjective quality of a sensory block however we also compared the time to sensory block as a secondary objective of the study and the results showed statistically significant difference between the two groups finally the duration of the block was not assessed in this study because of unreliability of the collected data these data are critical to making a definitive recommendation regarding the superiority of one combination over the other conclusionthis study showed that the c b combination was characterized by a clinically and statistically significant faster onset than the l b combination for interscalene blocks although both mixtures offered an adequate intraoperative anesthetic faster onset of action of 2 chloroprocaine can facilitate the early recognition of an unsuccessful block further studies are required to confirm the role of this combination in enhancing operating room turnover time and postoperative analgesic requirements references1 candido kd sukhani r doty r jr nader a kendall mc yaghmour e kataria tc mccarthy r neurologic sequelae after

In reaction to a wide variety of insults, glial cells respond with changes in cell morphology and metabolism to allow repair. Additionally, these cells can acquire migratory and proliferative potential. In particular, after axonal damage or pruning the clearance of axonal debris by glial cells is key for a healthy nervous system. Thus, bidirectional neuron-glial interactions are crucial in development, but little is known about the cellular sensors and signalling pathways involved. In here, we show that decreased cellular fitness in retinal progenitors caused by reduced Drosophila Myc expression triggers non cell-autonomous activation of retinal glia proliferation and overmigration. Glia migration occurs beyond its normal limit near the boundary between differentiated photoreceptors and precursor cells, extending into the progenitor domain. This overmigration is stimulated by JNK activation (and the function of its target Mmp1), while proliferative responses are mediated by Dpp/TGF-β signalling activation.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

hygiene is crucial in reducing infection rates hand hygiene compliance remains suboptimal this study was designed to determine hand hygiene compliance before and after an educational intervention and its impact on hospital infection rates method the study was done in neonatal intensive care unit of an educational hospital all healthcare providers working in the unit at the time of study were trained on importance of hand hygiene and methods of hand hygiene observation after that hand washing compliance controlled by a physician during postintervention phase hand hygiene compliance healthcare associated infection and mortality rates compared before and after educational intervention results compliance of health care workers for all hand hygiene opportunities combined was 30 before intervention and improved to 70 in postintervention in postintervention phase healthcare associated infection rates and mortality rates decreased significantly as the hand hygiene compliance improved conclusions good control of hand hygiene compliance by physician after an educational program may have good effect in healthcare associated infections control in neonatal intensive care unit

sunnerhagendoi 10 2340 16501977 0085 abstract objective to determine whether the barrow neurological institute screen for higher cerebral functions bnis can differentiate brain dysfunctional patients from controls design a case control study subjects a total of 92 controls and 120 patients from a neuro rehabilitation clinic with a diagnosis of right and left hemisphere stroke traumatic brain injury parkinson s disease or anoxic brain damage methods the bnis has a maximum total score of 50 points 47 indicates cognitive dysfunction group comparisons and exploration of variables influencing the bnis total score were made results a significant difference was found between the control group and the total patient group for the bnis total score and for the subscales p 0 0005 sensitivity was 88 and specificity 78 presence of disease and educational level had the greatest influence on the results of the bnis patients with parkinson s disease were shown to be the least cognitively affected and those with anoxic brain damage the most affected conclusion the bnis has potential value as a screening instrument for cognitive functions and is sufficiently sensitive to differentiate brain dysfunctional patients from a control population it appears to be applicable in a neurological rehabilitation setting and can be used early in the process giving a baseline cognitive functional level

min in the high performace liquid chromatography hplc system to 15 l min going into the mass spectrometer in pss a compound of interest in this case erythromycin 2 ethylsuccinate is enriched after the analytical separation on a short trapping column from which it is desorbed subsequently to the lc ms interface optimal mobile phases and flow rates can be used for the hplc separation as well as for the mass spectrometric detection desorption of the analyte is achieved either by using a flow rate of 15 l min without a splitter or a flow rate of 230 l min with a splitter compared to the lc cf fab

leptokurtosis or platykurtosis the distribution is defined by a power transformation y having a shifted and scaled truncated standard power exponential distribution with parameter the distribution has four parameters and is denoted bcpe the parameters and may be interpreted as relating to location median scale approximate coefficient of variation skewness transformation to symmetry and kurtosis power exponential parameter respectively smooth centile curves are obtained by modelling each of the four parameters of the distribution as a smooth non parametric function of an explanatory variable a fisher scoring algorithm is used to fit the non parametric model by maximizing a penalized likelihood the first and expected second and cross derivatives of the likelihood with respect to and required for the algorithm are provided the centiles of the bcpe distribution are easy to calculate so it is highly suited to centile estimation this application of the bcpe distribution to smooth centile estimation provides a generalization of the lms method of the centile estimation to data exhibiting kurtosis as well as skewness different from that of a normal distribution and is named here

polyrhachis species from west malaysia we found a considerable variety of recruitment techniques including social carrying behavior tandem running group recruitment and a technique which we call leader independent trail communication the latter mode superficially resembles chemical mass communication sensu wilson 1962 all these recruitment techniques involve mechanical invitation behavior inside the nest comprising back and forth jerking or pulling movement often combined with a sideways waggling however not in all cases of leader independent trail communication is a mechanical invitation behavior obligatory the trail pheromone of all investigated polyrhachis species originates from the hindgut only in the tandem running p proxima do additional secretions from the poison gland appear to be involved in tandem calling this is a preview of subscription content log in to check access access optionsbuy single articleinstant access to the full article pdf 29 95tax

explanation of chronic thyroiditis in man was sought in observations made on rabbits dogs guinea pigs and human subjects the rabbits received injections of saline extracts of rabbit thyroid glands the tests for circulating autoantibodies utilized the phenomena of precipitation complement fixation and tanned cell hemagglutination the third of these based upon the principle of altering the surface of the red blood cells by dilute tannic acid so that they absorb proteins was particularly sensitive the three tests were applied to serums from 35 rabbits injected with rabbit thyroid extract and thyroid autoantibodies were found in 32 structural damage was found in the thyroid roughly in proportion to the autoantibody titer in the serum similar studies were carried out in dogs and guinea pigs with canine and guinea pig thyroid extracts respectively the three tests were then applied to serums from patients with chronic thyroiditis twelve such patients were found whose serums contained circulating antibodies specifically directed against extracts of human thyroid glands three typical case histories are given with histological findings on thyroid tissue removed during surgery six other patients with chronic thyroiditis proved histologically were not found to have autoantibodies in their serums at the time of study these findings lead to the hypotheses that some types of chronic thyroiditis are related to an autoimmunization process within the patient against his own thyroid tissue and that thyroid autoantibodies are at once indicators and links in the chain of pathological processes full textdownload pdffull textcitethiscitationwitebsky e rose nr terplan k paine jr egan rw chronic thyroiditis and autoimmunization jama 1957 164 13 1439 1447 doi 10 1001 jama

containing coverings are based on diffusive saturation of blankets of boron details of cars together with other alloying elements in these processes according strength and operational characteristics of details thickness of a diffusive layer has the defining value which optimum value has been not found out yet key parameters from various indicators of technological processes are temperature and duration of technological parameter other parameters are added depending on specifics of diffusive layers method formation the diversity of the modes diffusive saturation of blankets of details promotes the reduction of stability of their technological and operational properties thus there is a problem of the tasks solution with multiple criteria and extrema in this work search of optimum parameters of processes of diffusion of one or several elements in steel 40xhma blankets is solved the device of planning of scientific research including a method of a complete factorial experiment together with a problem of linear programming of finding of multipliers of lagrange and a gradient method of search of optimum values according to the pareto principle of decisions was used for this purpose a result of the real work was finding out of the equations of regression of dependence of thickness of a diffusive boron layer on conditions of chemical heat treatment for a number of brands

To explore the local ecology of Leptospira spp. in a city experiencing rapid urbanization, we assessed Leptospira prevalence in rodents from three locations in Malaysian Borneo with differing levels of anthropogenic influence: 1) high but stable influence (urban); 2) moderate yet increasing (developing); and 3) low (rural). A total of 116 urban, 122 developing and 78 rural rodents were sampled, with the majority of individuals assigned to either the Rattus rattus lineage R3 (n = 165) or Sundamys muelleri (n = 100). Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in 31.6% of all rodents, with more urban rodents positive (44.8%), than developing (32.0%) or rural rodents (28.1%), and these differences were statistically significant. The majority of positive samples were identified by sequence comparison to belong to known human pathogens L. interrogans (n = 57) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 38). Statistical analyses revealed that both Leptospira species occurred more commonly at sites with higher anthropogenic influence, particularly those with a combination of commercial and residential activity, while L. interrogans infection was also associated with low forest cover, and L. borgpetersenii was more likely to be identified at sites without natural bodies of water. This study suggests that some features associated with urbanization may promote the circulation of Leptospira spp., resulting in a potential public health risk in cities that may be substantially underestimated.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

LLIN distribution at high coverage is considered to be one of the adjunctive transmission reduction strategies in Nepal's Malaria Strategic Plan 2014-2025. The main objective of this study was to assess the durability through assessment of community usage, physical integrity, residual bio-efficacy, and chemical retention in LLINs: Interceptor®, Yorkool®, and PermaNet ®2.0 which were used in Nepal during 2009 through 2013.\nMethods: Assessments were conducted on random samples (\nResults: On average, duration of use of LLINs was shortest for the Yorkool® samples, followed by PermaNet® 2.0 and Interceptor® with median ages of 8.9 (IQR = 0.4), 23.8 (IQR = 3.2), and 50.1 (IQR = 3.2) months, respectively. Over 80% of field distributed Yorkool® and PermaNet® 2.0 nets were in good condition (pHI< 25) compared to Interceptor® (66%). Bio-efficacy analysis showed that average mortality rates of Interceptor and Yorkool were below World Health Organization (WHO) optimal effectiveness of ≥ 80% compared to 2-year-old PermaNet 2.0 which attained 80%. Chemical retention analysis was consistent with bio-efficacy results.\nConclusion: This study shows that distribution of LLINs is effective for malaria control; however, serviceable life of LLINs should be considered in terms of waning residual bio-efficacy that warrants replacement. As an adjunctive malaria control tool, National Malaria Control Program of Nepal can benefit by renewing the distribution of LLINs in an appropriate time frame in addition to utilizing durable and effective LLINs.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

other marine organisms and an excellent source of lipids pigments carotenoids omega 3 fatty acids and surplus biochemical 1 in living schemes beneath stress conditions the excessive generation of hydroxyl oh and alternative extremely reactive oxygen species ros generates oxidative injury through the several biomolecules with ros as well as dna 2 very few studies were undergone to explore the quantification and documentation of antioxidant compounds of microalgae even though more antioxidant profile in microalgae have been affected 3 including the impact of phenolic in microalgae resistance systems opposing ros accumulation 4 carotenoids are the principal antioxidant compounds from microalgae they can be divided into two groups carotenes and xanthophylls acetylenic and allenic carotenoids such as fucoxanthin neoxanthin and violaxanthin correspondingly 5 are vastly epitomized in red and green algae and thirty various carotenoids as a minimum had been recognized in this class 6 it has been stated that carotenoids have diverse biological properties such as antioxidant anti inflammatory antiproliferative antiatherogenic and chemotherapeutic agent to treat several types of cancer such as stomach lung liver breast colon and prostate cell disruption is generally essential for recovering intracellular products from microalgae the cell walls can intensely modify any extraction method by lowering the cell biodegradability 7 the cell disruption methods such as mechanical and chemical treatments including high pressure homogenizers supercritical fluid pressurized liquid ultrasounds microwaves autoclaving and addition of sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or alkaline lysis have been used effectively 8 the above techniques have some hitches correlated to the thermal denaturation of by products that might be due to their raised extraction temperature 9 10 11 hence selecting of a suitable extraction method counts on numerous factors such as biomass with its extract end use and thermolability 12 13 the solvents are extensively used to extract algal metabolites from algal biomass 14 for instance solvent residues the presence of the cell wall and physiological properties such as location of the bioactive content stored in the cell could prevent direct contact between the solvent and cell membrane that hinder the extraction 15 at times solvent extraction of dry biomass has evidenced successful recovery of intracellular metabolites than wet biomass 16 homogenization disrupts the cell wall when cells are forced through a small opening at high pressures allowing the extraction of biomolecules 17 supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide co2 as an extraction fluid illustrates an effective substitute to conventional techniques in relation to purity and yield 9 12 the pressurized liquid extraction has validated to be a sound alternative to improve the extraction yield of lipids and carotenoids 18 chlorella ovalis nannochloropsis oculata and dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae showed antiproliferative and anti inflammatory properties 19 nannochloropsis sp nc exhibited strong antioxidant activates in a similar study performed earlier 20 very few therapeutic biochemical acquired from algae have been successfully marketed and many are underneath clinical trials 21 hence the assessment of such properties endures a motivating and worthwhile task mainly for discovering innovative sources of natural antioxidants nc of the eustigmatophyceae class and chlorophyceae green algal group around 2 5 m width is spherical and unicellular 22 which stores carotenoids in stressful states amphora considered as the principal species is a key group of marine and freshwater diatoms which are under class bacillariophyceae order thalassiophysales and family catenulaceae nostoc belongs to family nostocaceae and order nostocales are present in diverse environments that form colonies comprising filaments of moniliform cells coming under cyanobacteria 23 it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive screening of the therapeutic activities for nc since only few studies have been done the principal stimulation to initiate this work attributes to inadequate data on biochemicals and their properties in algal species the foremost objective of this paper is to select the microalgae after primary 1 1

preliminary antioxidant assessment the stationary phases of nc and amphora sp displayed potent rsas compared to the nostoc sp hence the stationary phase of nc species was selected for further extraction processes partial purification and biochemical studies the solvent selection was significant to uphold the extraction since it establishes the degree of affinity to the chemical composition of the constituents to be extracted the extraction proficiency was highly reliant on polarity of the organic solvent or solvent mixture used in this study the extraction process effect on yield and biological screening was assessed with solvents of differing polarities such as acetone 0 355 ethyl acetate 0 460 and ethanol 0 654 50 the greener solvents used were food grade less toxic easily available and extract phytochemicals effectually 51 the extraction yield from high to low were as follows ethyl acetate ethanol acetone in general the yield improves with increase in the polarity of solvents wherein this case ethyl acetate gave higher yield which might attribute to the type of algae biochemical accumulation in algae solvent polarity storage and extraction conditions 52 53 moreover the differences in solvent polarity used determine the type composition and aa of phytochemicals 54 ethyl acetate effectively extracts alkaloid glycosides terpenoid sterol and flavonoid ethanol can successfully separate polar compounds such as sugar amino acid glycoside compounds phenolic compounds with low and medium molecular weights flavonoid terpenoid anthocyanin saponin tannin phenone flavone and polyphenol 55 acetone was used to extract photosynthetic pigments with a wide range of polarity 51 phytochemical screening showed a positive test for flavonoids proteins carbohydrates terpenoids steroids phenols and saponins which were evidenced by hptlc analysis the total phenolic content tpc total flavonoid content tfc tcc and tsc of the eaenh were efficiently good the quantity of tpc was higher in polar than nonpolar solvents the deviations in tpc from solvent extracts were ascribed to the polarities of various compounds present in the algae the tpc tfc and tsc were in the order as follows eaenh eenh aenh overall the extractability of a specific compound was a function of the ratio of solute to solvent in this study the recovery of tpc seemed to be reliant on the solvent typology its polarity index and solubility of tpc in the extraction solvent the solubility of polyphenols or flavonoids depends on the molecular size hydroxyl groups and length of the hydrocarbon 56 the results indicate that the maximum tfc was shown by eaenh which might be attributed to the purification and concentration of polyphenolics through the fractionation process which was possibly responsible for its significant antioxidant property position oh and double bonds in flavonoid were determined to give escalated aa 57 the tcc was in the order as follows aenh eaenh eenh the presence of conjugated double bonds in oxygenated diterpenoids i e xanthophylls rich in eaenh attribute to its effectual aa the tsc was predominant in eaenh compared to the other fractions accountable

which were regulated by polyphenols the reports were concurring with earlier studies where algal extracts illustrated affirmative biological activities in relation to antioxidant and antimicrobial activities which were contributed by the distinct biochemicals in nc 59 antiproliferative effect of the eaenhwas investigated using human non small lung cancer cell line a 549 the cell toxicity was found to be dose dependent recent research stated the antioxidant and anticancer activities of ethanol extract of freshwater microalga chloromonas sp etch could serve as potential therapeutic candidate against human cancers such as hela a375 and hs578t 60 similar study revealed the phytochemicals of chlorella vulgaris could be responsible for exhibiting anticancer activities against mcf 7 cancer cell lines with ic50 value of 31 2 g ml 61 conclusion this study reported that eaenh fractions showed potential antioxidant and moderate cytotoxic activity the phytochemical assessment established the dominance of saponins terpenoids flavonoids and phenolic acids supporting its valuable antioxidant and antiproliferative properties which were further authenticated by hptlc ftir and gcms analysis future researches are essential to efficaciously isolate and purify the biochemicals from the hexane fractions signifying their potential to explore expanded investigations for enhancing their production by implementing advanced molecular biotechnological techniques it was evident that secondary metabolites enriched in nannochloropsis act as a prime basis for further pharmacological

Multiecho chemical-shift based water-fat separation methods estimate and correct for Bo field inhomogeneity. However, they must contend with the intrinsic challenge of water-fat ambiguity that can result in water-fat swapping. This problem arises because the signals from two chemical species, when both are modeled as a single discrete spectral peak, may appear indistinguishable in the presence of Bo off-resonance. In conventional methods, the water-fat ambiguity is typically removed by enforcing field map smoothness using region growing based algorithms. In reality, the fat spectrum has multiple spectral peaks. Using this spectral complexity, we introduce a novel concept that identifies water and fat for multiecho acquisitions by exploiting the spectral differences between water and fat. A fat likelihood map is produced to indicate if a pixel is likely to be water-dominant or fat-dominant by comparing the fitting residuals of two different signal models. The fat likelihood analysis and field map smoothness provide complementary information, and we designed an algorithm (Fat Likelihood Analysis for Multiecho Signals) to exploit both mechanisms. It is demonstrated in a wide variety of data that the Fat Likelihood Analysis for Multiecho Signals algorithm offers highly robust water-fat separation for 6-echo acquisitions, particularly in some previously challenging applications.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

transplantation was initially described in 1972 but became clinically relevant in 1988 after the first cb transplantation in fanconi anemia soon afterwards private blood banks were established to store umbilical cord blood and stem cells individually until 11 2009 n 400 cb transplantations from private cord blood banks including clinical trials are confirmed to be performed worldwide leukemia is among several indications cb is used for for in depth analysis an evaluation was done for this subgroup methods for the first time a comprehensive meta analysis with a database was performed covering all known cord blood transplantations n 400 worldwide from private storage between 1993 and 2009 a variety of parameters were analyzed e g disease age sex type of use hla status storage time

analyze the efficacy of empirical antibiotics in the light of microbiological data in hap cases methods suspected cases of hap were followed for clinico bacterial evidence antimicrobial resistance and pre and post culture antibiotic use the study was taken from february 2014 to july 2014 in department of microbiology and department of respiratory medicine prospectively data was analyzed by microsoft office excel 2007 results out of 758 cases investigated 77 10 cases were hap 65 84 of them were culture positive and 48 74 were late in onset in early onset cases isolates were acinetobacter 10 42 escherichia coli 5 21 s aureus 4 17 klebsiella 1 4 and pseudomonas 1 4 from the late onset cases acinetobacter 15 28 klebsiella 17 32 and pseudomonas 13 24 were isolated all acinetobacter 78 klebsiella and 36 pseudomonas isolates were multi drug resistant empirical therapies were inadequate in 12 70 of early onset cases and 44 92 of late onset type cephalosporins were used in 7 41 of early onset infections but found to be adequate only in 2 12 cases polymyxins were avoided empirically but after cultures were used in 9 19 cases conclusions empirical antibiotics were vastly inadequate more frequently so in late onset infections use of cephalosporins empirically in early onset infections and avoiding empirical use of polymyxin antibiotics in late onset infections

recovery and genetic characterization of mutant alleles at zygotic loci on the third chromosome ofdrosophila melanogaster which alter the morphology of the larval cuticle we derived 12600 single lines from ethyl methane sulfonate ems treatedst e orrucuca chromosomes and assayed them for embryonic lethal mutations by estimating hatch rates of egg collections about 7100 of these lines yielded at least a quarter of unhatched eggs and were then scored for embryonic phenotypes through microscopic examination of unhatched eggs 1772 lines corresponding to 24 of all lethal hits were classified as embryonic lethal in 198 lines 2 7 of all lethal hits mutant embryos showed distinct abnormalities of the larval cuticle these embryonic visible mutants define 45 loci by complementation analysis for 32 loci more than one mutant allele was recovered with an average of 5 8 alleles per locus complementation of all other mutants was shown by 13 mutants the genes were localized on the genetic map by recombination analysis as well as cytologically by complementation analysis with deficiencies they appear to be randomly distributed along the chromosome allele frequencies and comparisons with deficiency phenotypes indicate that the 45 loci represent most if not all zygotic loci on the third chromosome where lack of function recognizably affects the morphology of the larval cuticle this is

particularly vulnerable due to associated changes in water quality and habitat availability condition and connectivity accordingly fish assemblages are ideal indicators of the impacts of drought and over abstraction the murray darling basin mdb south eastern australia terminates at the ramsar listed coorong and lower lakes which comprise lake alexandrina and lake albert over abstraction and extreme drought during the last decade has placed these lakes under severe environmental stress the purpose of this study was to investigate shifts in fish assemblages caused by substantial water level recession and salinization in the lower lakes small bodied fish assemblages were sampled at the beginning and several years into the drought off lake habitats held diverse fish assemblages in 2003 but most sites were dry by 2009 remaining habitats were disconnected salinities increased substantially and aquatic vegetation shifted from freshwater to salt tolerant species there was a substantial decline in the proportion of specialist species especially diadromous and threatened species and an emerging dominance of generalist freshwater and estuarine species the findings warn of the inevitable ecological impact of over allocating water for human use in drought prone regions and highlight the need for adequate environmental water allocations this study also emphasises that understanding the ecological attributes of a fish species and the subsequent assignment to a functional group will help predict vulnerability to decline and extirpation this is a preview of

TWINSCAN is a gene-prediction system that combines the methods of single-genome predictors like GENSCAN with information derived from genome comparison, thereby improving accuracy. Because TWINSCAN uses genomic sequence only, it is less biased toward highly and/or ubiquitously expressed genes than GENEWISE, GENOMESCAN, and other methods based on evidence derived from transcripts. We show that TWINSCAN improves gene prediction in human using intermediate products from various stages of the sequencing and analysis of the mouse genome, from low-redundancy, whole-genome shotgun reads to the draft assembly and the synteny map. TWINSCAN improves on the prior state of the art even when alignments from only 1X coverage of the mouse genome are available. Gene prediction accuracy improves steadily from 1X through 3X, more slowly from 3X to 4X, and relatively little thereafter. The assembly and the synteny map greatly speed the computations, however.

mspmid 21515223abstractfull textreferencessupplementary materialscited bypdfabstract background the number of pet cats is increasing in most countries often outnumbering pet dogs yet cats receive less veterinary care than their canine counterparts 1 clients state the difficulty of getting the cat into a carrier at home driving to the clinic and dealing with the fearful cat at the veterinary clinic as reasons for fewer visits 2 educating and preparing the client and the veterinary team with regard to respectful feline handling is necessary in order to avoid stress and accomplish the goal of good health care without such preparation feline stress may escalate into fear or fear associated aggression the resulting stress may alter results of the physical examination and laboratory tests leading to incorrect diagnoses eg diabetes mellitus and unnecessary treatments 3 5 without compassionate and respectful handling by the veterinary team clients may feel the team lacks skills and compassion or does not understand cats injury may occur to the cat client and or veterinary team 6 clients who want to avoid stress for their cat may avoid veterinary visits or choose another practice instead goals the use of feline friendly handling techniques should reduce these problems handling is most successful when the veterinary team adapts the approach to each individual cat and situation the goal of these guidelines is to provide useful information for handling cats that can lead to reduced fear and pain for the cat reinforced veterinarian client cat bond trust and confidence and thus better lifelong medical care for the cat improved efficiency productivity and job satisfaction for the veterinary team increased client compliance timely reporting and early detection of medical and behavioral concerns fewer injuries to clients and the veterinary team reduced anxiety for the client the standard of veterinary excellencethe aafp and isfm welcome endorsement of these guidelines by the american animal hospital association aaha social behavior and communicationpeople often misinterpret cat behavior and how cats deal with stress and conflict veterinary teams can help clients create realistic expectations about feline behavior and how to resolve problems begin by educating the team and your clients about the unique social and behavioral characteristics of the cat help them learn to interpret behaviors from the animal s perspective that is to think like a cat feline behavior conceptshistorically people kept cats for their ability to hunt and kill rodents rather than for other traits so people did not significantly modify the cat s innate behaviors by genetic selection 7 8 cats need an outlet for hunting behavior hunting is also a component of play in cats it may be possible to distract them in the clinic using an interactive toy such as a toy mouse on a wire cats are solitary hunters they avoid fights with other cats whenever possible they achieve this by distancing themselves from other cats 9 cats often respond to confrontation by avoidance or hiding with fighting only occurring as a last resort allowing cats to feel hidden while they are at the veterinary practice using items such as towels or carriers may facilitate handling feline boldness and acceptance of novelty and interaction vary with genetic predisposition and environment socialization and habituation to human handling starting between 2 7 weeks of age improves feline human relationships 10 nonetheless human agitation rough handling sudden or erratic movements or loud voices may cause an unexpected or sudden fearful or aggressive reaction in the cat cats are social animals interacting primarily with cats within the same colony cats do not have an innate ability to tolerate unfamiliar cats at initial introduction 11 13 as both predator and prey animals cats often show fear or defensiveness in unfamiliar environments or with unfamiliar people 11 14 this behavior may be covert not obvious rather than overt easily seen cats reserve tactile communication with other cats for members of their feline social group or colony cats show affiliation and maintain the colony odor by allorubbing rubbing against another often misinterpreted when it is directed toward humans as a request for food or affection and allogrooming grooming each other generally on the head and neck 15 16 most cats prefer the head and neck for physical touch cats may become upset and even aggressive when people try to pet them in other areas eg increased arousal and rolling skin when the back is touched clasping human hands and arms with feline claws when touched on the stomach after rolling onto their back 11 17 18 recognizing anxiety and fearfear is a response that enables avoidance of perceived danger 9 anxiety results from the anticipation of an adverse event based on a previously negative fearful or painful experience 19 early signs of fear and anxietymost veterinary team members can recognize facial and postural signs of advanced fearful aggressive behavior the different behavioral displays shown here demonstrate points at which the veterinary team can attempt to defuse escalating fearful or fear aggressive behaviors well before a cat is fully aroused body posturesthis cat shows increasing signs of fear as a technician approaches the cat displayed the below

to confrontation by avoidance or hiding with experience one can learn to recognize subtle early signs of fear or anxiety see below and their related aggressive behavioral responses 20 recognizing these signs early allows measures to be taken to prevent escalation to a full blown response of fear aggression ear position body posture and tail movement are helpful indicators of a cat s state of mind 9 21 changes in the eyes and face also give clues to mounting anxiety anxious or fearful cats may produce increased sweat from their paws anxiety and fear can also be recognized by changes in vocalization from distress meowing to growling hissing and spitting cats lack techniques to resolve conflict by appeasing each other and instead freeze flee fight or engage in displacement behaviors eg self grooming acquiescence silence and or lack of movement do not signal lack of pain or lack of anxiety a cat that freezes is signaling that it is anxious or uncomfortable 22 preparing client and cat for the veterinary visittaking the time to accustom the kitten or cat to travel and handling can reduce the stress of veterinary visits throughout the cat s life the veterinary team and the client can work together to develop strategies to prepare cats for positive veterinary experiences where possible the team and or client as appropriate should rehearse visits to the veterinary practice hospital or clinic with positive rewards eg tasty treats to introduce the cat to the practice and being around other people and cats reward and reinforce all desired behavior using technician or veterinary nurse appointments to introduce the cat to the practice and being around other people and cats avoid punishing cats either physically or verbally because this can have unintended effects such as increased or redirected aggression 23 offer client education classes either kitten classes or classes for owners of kittens these allow opportunities to educate owners about positive handling of kittens to help familiarize kittens to different people and a variety of positive situations rehearse clinical examinations and learn to do procedures at home using calm praise and pairing these procedures with positive reinforcement through food or other rewards eg play catnip massaging the neck or chin gently perform these procedures as demonstrated by a member of the veterinary team handling the paws and looking into the ears to prepare for ear exams and nail clipping opening the mouth in association with the delivery of a tasty treat to prepare for oral examinations administration of oral medications or tooth brushing feeling over the legs and the body to prepare for the physical exam grooming doing regular medical procedures at home eg administering prescribed parasite prevention taking blood glucose measurements in diabetic patients adapt cats to carriers see page 367 take kittens and cats on occasional short car rides beginning at an early age if possible locate the cat well before departure on the day of the visit in order to leave on time encourage the cat to enter the carrier on its own see page 367 bring items that carry a familiar scent for the cat such as favorite bedding or toys notify the veterinary team in advance if the cat may be easily upset this will allow them to prepare eg move cat to exam room immediately have treats and toys available to distract the cat the veterinary team may provide flexibility and choice tailoring the appointment to each individual client and cat as appropriate for example some cats do better with house calls others do not understand the effect of your own anxiety or stress on the cat remaining calm and reducing any outward display of fear and anxiety remain positive proceed at the cat s pace remain aware of the cat s responses and use rewards that encourage desired behaviors treats food toys massage if indicated use prescribed anxiolytics and or anti nausea medication for the cat pre plan for the cat s return home see going home section see table 1 page 373 and the further reading list page 374 for helpful resources allowing cats to feel hidden while they are at the veterinary practice may facilitate handling cat carrierscarriers provide safety for both client and cat during transport 24 and often give a cat a sense of security by being hidden in a secure closed container surveys are ongoing to determine the best attributes of carriers they should however be sturdy secure and stable for the cat easy for the client to carry and quiet so that opening the carrier does not startle the cat some cats like to see out whereas others are less anxious when covered the design should permit easy removal of the cat if it will not come out on its own or should allow the cat to be easily examined in the bottom of its carrier a removable top is useful for fearful and fear aggressive cats as well as for sick painful or limited mobility cats carriers provide safety for both client and

encourage the cat to enter the carrier at home some owners may find it helpful to train the cat to enter the carrier using a word or clicker as a cue individual cats respond differently to treats use

carrier voluntarily getting an unwilling cat into the carrierif the cat has not been accustomed to the carrier at the time a veterinary visit is imminent plan a strategy that will work with the type of carrier and the home environment putting the carrier in a small room with few hiding places may encourage the cat to choose the carrier consider use of a synthetic feline facial pheromone ffp analog spray in the carrier at least 30 minutes prior to transport to help calm the cat open the carrier and place familiar bedding a toy and or treat inside encourage the cat to enter the carrier voluntarily do not chase the cat to get it into the carrier if needed remove the top of the carrier while encouraging the cat to go into the bottom tray then calmly replace the top transporting the carrier in a vehicleprior to any scheduled veterinary visit practice lifting the carrier and getting it in and out of the car try this first without the cat to be sure that there isn t too much jostling or knocking of the carrier and then with the cat inside during travel secure the carrier by placing it on the floor or by using a seatbelt because a moving carrier can frighten the cat

positive environment manage odors manage odors by cleaning surfaces washing hands and removing lint between patients ventilate after all olfactory incidents eg disposing the trash after anal gland expression cleaning where another cat has walked or rubbed on furniture 25 cats are macrosmatic their sensitive sense of smell drives many of their behavioral responses some odors eg air fresheners disinfectants rubbing alcohol blood deodorant perfume and unfamiliar clothing may cause anxiety or fear 26 28 consider using a synthetic feline facial pheromone analog studies show that a synthetic ffp analog may have calming effects in stressful environments reducing anxiety fear and aggression and increasing normal grooming and food intake in caged cats 29 32 cats may benefit from diffusers placed throughout the hospital and a spray used about 30 minutes in advance on materials used for cats to lie on in cages as well as on towels used for handling use ffp only in addition to and never as a substitute for removing odors washing gentle handling and other provisions for creating a cat friendly environment manage visual and auditory input minimize visual cues that may lead to anxiety keep other patients away from the cat s line of vision when possible provide a separate feline entrance and feline waiting room or area cover cat carriers with a blanket or towel minimize harsh lighting 33 34 provide a quiet environment and speak softly minimize noise that might startle the cat such as phones and fans consider using soothing background music and acoustic dampeners if you have a resident cat be aware that it may elicit anxiety in a patient if it is seen smelled or heard train staff to recognize any signs of feline stress both in the practice cat and in the patients and be ready to either respond or prevent access of the practice cat to patient areas preparing the practice environmentsetting the stagesome key considerations for creating a cat friendly environment which apply throughout the hospital are outlined in the box above waiting room reception areaminimize waiting times by using scheduled appointments if possible modify the schedule to provide for cat appointments during quieter times of the day cat and dog appointments at different times different times and or days for admitting cats and dogs for surgery direct the client and cat into the exam room as soon as possible to avoid other pets and noise if this is not possible minimize cat cat or dog cat interaction if both are in the waiting room by educating clients with dogs to keep away from feline patients providing separate dog and cat waiting rooms or using screens to create separate dog cat areas keep cat carriers off the floor create elevated shelves above dog nose height or use a stable chair that is not facing another pet have towels blankets available to drape over the carrier if necessary exam consulting roomif the hospital sees more than feline patients try to dedicate a minimum of one exam room to cats only be flexible in your choice of where the exam occurs eg exam table scale chair couch or floor conduct the exam wherever the cat is most comfortable fig 1 to remove scent signals such as alarm pheromones use disinfecting soaps or washing powders that remove both protein and fat which are part of the make up of pheromones have available a variety of treats disposable giveaway toys and or catnip treated towels to positively engage the cat the response to catnip and similar plants will vary due to genetic differences 35 36 downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 1 examine the cat where it is comfortable such as on an exam room bench courtesy of dr ilona rodan cat cages in the veterinary practiceif possible provide cat only rooms the optimal cat cage has the following attributes is large enough to accommodate the client s carrier and for the litter box to be away from food bedding and water is at mid level or higher side by side cages are preferable to cages facing each other so that the cats do not see each other and become visually aroused 37 provides a safe haven with both hiding and perching places eg sturdy cardboard box if a cat shows less anxiety when in a darker area cover the front of the cage with a towel has controlled temperature and sound insulation note that fiberglass cages are warmer less reflective and quieter than stainless steel contains a towel and or toys from home contains the cat s preferred food and litter while this may not be possible with every patient it may help those that are anxious or fearful consider asking clients to bring in the cat s own food interacting with the cat in the veterinary practicepreparing to greet the catthe first encounter with the cat will impact the success of the current and subsequent visits where possible appoint specific cat friendly team members greet cats and clients by their names with moderated body language and voice be aware of any special requirements of the individual patient before the cat arrives playful kittens are easily distracted by toys or treats middle aged and senior cats frequently have degenerative joint disease and need soft surfaces to keep them comfortable be aware that pain levels with chronic conditions will vary 38 as much as possible have equipment needed for examination and testing in the exam room before handling the cat to minimize the negative effects of gestures and noise have all your materials prepared eg syringes out of their wrappers use silent clippers or scissors think go slow to go fast for most cats using a slow approach is more efficient in achieving the results you want adopt a calm positive demeanor and work at a consistent pace downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 2 if a cat prefers to stay in its carrier using a towel to cover the cat as the top of the carrier is removed can decrease its anxiety this technique is also the first step to putting a towel over a cat that is displaying fear aggression courtesy of dr eliza sundahl downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 3 examining a cat while it remains in the bottom of the carrier may be less stressful for the cat courtesy of dr eliza sundahl think go slow to go fast for most cats using a slow approach is more efficient in achieving the results you want opening the carrier and accessing the catopen the door of the carrier while taking the history to allow the cat to choose whether it wants to venture out on its own some cats may walk out of the carrier more readily if it is on the floor if the cat is out of the carrier put the closed carrier out of sight during the exam but allow the cat to return to it immediately the procedures are completed calm cats that enjoy the experience may be left to explore the exam room if appropriate if the cat is still in the carrier when you finish history taking quietly remove the top and door if possible most cats are very comfortable remaining in the bottom half of the carrier and will allow a large portion of the examination while being there if the cat is fearful place a towel between the two halves of the carrier as you remove the carrier top this covers the cat in a tent but the cat remains accessible fig 2 some carriers cannot be disassembled opinions vary about appropriate techniques for removing a cat from this type of carrier with little or no evidence to show which are safest and least stressful if the cat will not come out on its own but will accept handling try the techniques listed below if the cat will not come out of the carrier do what you can to work with the cat within the carrier fig 3 avoid grabbing the cat to pull it out do not tip the carrier up on its end to shake the cat out or for the cat to fall out avoid the use of cat bags nets and gloves see later with calm cats reach in and support the caudal abdomen and back legs to encourage the cat to move forward if the cat acts in a fearful manner gently slide a towel around the cat to remove it if the cat shows continued resistance and or signs of fear follow tips in the section on chemical restraint and dealing with the fearful aggressive cat avoid escalating fear in the cat discuss carrier choice with the client see page 367 recognizing and responding to cat signalsrely on the cat s response body language to determine your own behavior fig 4 recognize early signs of arousal if needed break longer procedures into steps to prevent escalation of fear if the cat begins to show fear slow down or take breaks from handling to prevent escalation of arousal some cats get worse with breaks and repeated attempts to handle even with premedication these patients should be sedated or anesthetized with the use of anti anxiety medications that might also have an amnesiac effect eg benzodiazepines these cats may improve over several years try using treats or a synthetic ffp analog evaluate the potential stress of multiple procedures and adjust timing accordingly if the cat becomes aroused determine your strategy early and be ready to change your technique to accommodate a rapidly escalating anxiety event see later discussion on dealing with fearful aggressive cats consider these options hospitalize the cat to carry out additional procedures later that day use chemical restraint reschedule for another time when a better strategy eg premedication can be in place always try to end the visit on a positive note with client and cat as calm as possible performing the exam and working with the catlearn a variety of techniques and positions for each procedure and be flexible with each individual patient try the following techniques downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 4 cats hold back their ears for different reasons this cat is relaxed and happy courtesy of dr anne claire gagnon place towels or non slip pads under the cat or keep the cat on top of the familiar bedding from the carrier the latter is preferable because the familiar smell may make the cat more secure in the hospital environment examine the cat in a lap preferably your lap with the cat facing the client and away from you always have bedding underneath the cat and on your lap use your body and arm to support the cat allow the cat to maintain its chosen position vary your touch with the cat s response the head and neck are preferred areas of touch for the cat placing your hand on the head and massaging between the eyes or cranial aspect of the ears may calm the cat fig 5 other cats will remain still if you place a hand in front of the chest swaddle the cat in a towel fig 6 or cover the cat s head with a blanket as this may make the cat feel more secure whenever possible perform procedures in the exam room 39 most clients appreciate being present but if their anxiety is making the situation worse for the cat politely ask the client to step out of the exam room rather than move the cat making human behaviors less threatening for the catavoid direct eye contact move slowly and deliberately minimize hand gestures put yourself on the same level as the cat approach from the side and do not loom above or over the cat use a calm quiet voice animated discussions may engage the client but scare the cat if the cat is anxious return it to the carrier before going over instructions with the client unless you need to demonstrate a technique be aware of your own emotions and their potential effect on the cat s behavior downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 5 massaging or stroking the top of the head can help relax a cat while doing procedures such as taking blood pressure the first and fifth digits help hold each side of the head to prevent movement that could cause injury courtesy of dr ilona rodan downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 6 a cats may feel more secure lightly swaddled in a towel while on an exam surface as in the case of this mildly anxious cat she is more relaxed with this technique than exploring the room or staying in her carrier b using a towel to wrap around a cat can provide varying degrees of restraint and control this towel technique is excellent for cephalic venepuncture courtesy of dr eliza sundahl image a and dr sophia yin image b minimizing the stress of medical procedureswhen performing multiple procedures begin with those less stressful or invasive 40 offer different routes of administering medications when available show the client how to give pills consider pilling aid devices food or tasty treats in which pills can be hidden 41 consider warming injections to room temperature if this does not affect product efficacy use one needle to aspirate vaccine or drug and a different small gauge needle to administer injections 42 holding the head and body in natural positions may allow procedures such as jugular cephalic venepuncture and cysto centesis fig 7 with minimal restraint for cats that react strongly when touched with a needle and or when multiple injections are anticipated apply a topical anesthetic or use a transmucosal opioid downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 7 many procedures require minimal restraint if the cat is in a natural position such as in this standing cystocentesis courtesy of professor dani lle gunn moore about scruffing techniques scruffing is a general term for a variety of holds on the skin of the cat s neck grasping the scruff of the neck varies from a gentle squeeze of skin to grasping a larger fold of skin with varying amounts of pressure consideration of natural feline behavior can help put this technique into perspective cats grasp the scruff of the neck of other cats in only limited circumstances 43 44 during the first few weeks of life the mother cat may lift kittens by the scruff of the neck using her mouth 45 this is a method of transport and immobilization and not a form of discipline during mating the tomcat grasps the scruff of the queen 46 47 some veterinarians and veterinary behaviorists do not use scruffing and do not condone its use they find that using other gentle handling techniques is less stressful more time efficient provides greater safety for personnel and allows the cat to have a sense of control they prefer other methods to manage situations where feline welfare or personnel safety are at stake other veterinarians handle cats gently and use scruffing only if it is necessary to protect the welfare of the cat or for the physical protection of personnel still others think that scruffing a cat is acceptable for short procedures in an emergency and to prevent the cat from escaping or injuring someone if you think this technique is the only alternative carefully evaluate the cat for any signs of fear or anxiety the cat may become immobile but may not be comfortable or may become aggressive handle the cat as gently as possible and guard against using aggressive handling techniques out of anger or frustration the panel does not condone lifting the cat or suspending its body weight with a scruffing technique because it is unnecessary and potentially painful the panel does not condone lifting the cat or suspending its body weight with a scruffing technique clipping or pinch induced behavioral inhibition is a term that pertains to using clips to apply pressure to the dorsal neck skin or other areas along the dorsal midline 44 some veterinarians and behaviorists do not use clipping and do not condone its use some have reservations about the clipping procedure and have concerns about the ethics of controlling behavior through inhibition of behavioral responses others think it has a place when done appropriately in certain cats and under the conditions described above for scruffing 48 50 techniques for working with fearful or aggressive catsveterinarians may need to work with feral cats or fractious cats that could injure clients or the team cats may show anxiety aggression and fear via a variety of behaviors fear is the most common cause of aggression in cats at the veterinary practice learn to recognize early signs and take steps to reduce or prevent escalation of fear carefully evaluate the situation to select the most appropriate action pre visit techniqueswhen making appointments ask about and then record the client s comments about the cat s behavior at home and during previous visits record in the client file in clinic experiences about what works and what does not make attempts to decrease fear associated with the carrier using the techniques described earlier provide oral medication to manage the cat s fear prior to a visit if the history or owner comments suggest this might be helpful use an oral benzodiazepine eg alprazolam as an anxiolytic and possible amnesiac note that benzodiazepines may cause disinhibition of aggression use anti nausea medication eg maropitant for cats with travel induced nausea or emesis 51 avoid using acepromazine because it is a sedative not an anxiolytic it limits motor responses without modifying sensory perception it increases sensitivity to noises and it may increase aggression making the cat more combative specific treatment protocols vary by country and among veterinarians consult with an anesthesiologist for further information chemical restraint at the veterinary practicechemical restraint may increase safety and reduce stress for the cat client and veterinary team it is always better to use chemical restraint pre emptively because once the cat is agitated chemical restraint is less effective or reliable indications for chemical restraint are shown on the right medications that utilize intramuscular or subcutaneous administration are optimal because their use requires less restraint use reversible agents when possible one choice is to use the following regimen 54 provided there are no contraindications low dose dexmedetomidine which is reversible combined with an opioid for sedation choose an opioid based on the predicted degree of sedation and analgesia required mu op3 agonist narcotics eg morphine hydromorphone are reversible however butorphanol is short acting and may be suitable for some procedures add a benzodiazepine midazolam for its hypnotic sedative muscle relaxation and possible amnesic effects also reversible 55 add a small amount of ketamine for further sedation if a cat is not sufficiently sedated with the combination of an opioid dexmedetomidine and midazolam indications for chemical restraintwhen a cat shows signs of fear anxiety or aggression and the procedure will take longer without chemical restraint situations in which you anticipate pain discomfort or surgery and where analgesia alone will be insufficient when gentle restraint or appropriate restraint equipment does not provide sufficient safety for the team use general anesthesia if sedation is insufficient to accomplish necessary procedures note that the use of an induction chamber with gas anesthetic as a method of restraint may mean less control of the patient s airway and raises concerns about other safety issues for the cat and the staff 56 chemical restraint choices vary among veterinarians and will depend on patient signalment and physical status product availability varies by country obtain advice from an anesthesiologist if necessary a variety of resources contain specific protocols 54 the websites of the veterinary anesthesia and analgesia support group and the american college of veterinary anesthesiologists contain more information see table 1 fear is the most common cause of aggression in cats at the veterinary practice learn to recognize early signs and take steps to reduce or prevent escalation of fear working with the cat at the practicewhen a fearful anxious cat is anticipated if possible see it immediately upon arrival try any or all of the techniques described in the pre visit section as appropriate a synthetic ffp analog may make cats calmer but does not reduce struggling 52 if the cat is experiencing pain and or a procedure is likely to cause pain then premedicate with analgesics use minimal restraint and divide procedures into smaller steps refer to the aaha aafp pain management guidelines for information about under recognized painful conditions and treatments in cats 22 a variety of types of equipment are available to assist with feline handling reserve these for times when milder techniques are not effective be sensitive to the cat s response to any item used and moderate as needed disinfect materials between use use of the following will vary with the needs of the individual cat and veterinarian towels or muzzles that cover the eyes might calm cats by reducing the intensity of visual stimuli they do not immobilize the cat gloves may protect human arms and hands to some extent some panelists do not use gloves because they do not control the cat s movement in the way that towels do and may carry odors that may further arouse the cat 53 nets should be used only rarely such as when a cat is difficult to get out of a cage for quick sedation or in an emergency situation to capture a loose cat make sure it is a clam shell style net designed for the capture of small mammals ie with holes much smaller than for fish to prevent the cat s toes from getting caught in the netting do not use a net to immobilize the cat unless the procedure can be completed within a few seconds eg an injection some panelists never condone the use of nets cat bags designed for restraint can allow access to the front leg for cephalic venepuncture and the dorsal shoulder for subcutaneous fluid injections be aware that getting a cat into a cat bag may be difficult and that a tight bag may lead to panic while a loose bag may not provide sufficient restraint a well placed towel wrap may be more comfortable and form fitting going homewhen cats return home they may carry unfamiliar materials eg bandages or unfamiliar odors eg elimination of inhalation anesthetic byproducts may create odors for 24 48 hours other cats may fail to recognize the returning cat and may attack them to reduce problems ask clients whether problems with re introduction have occurred in the past and consider the procedures that were performed at the veterinary practice general tips for reducing inter cat aggression at homeask clients to bring something that smells like home when they drop off or pick up their cat fig 8 consider the use of a synthetic ffp analog in the carrier and at home advise clients to be passive when bringing a cat home do not encourage or force interaction between the cats or communal feeding where there is no history of aggressionif the cats have no history of aggression after veterinary visits try these steps leave the returning cat in the carrier to see how the other cat s react if no hissing or signs of aggression fear occur leave the cats together with the returning cat still in the carrier and with supervision for approximately 5 10 minutes next leave the cats free in the same room together and monitor for any reaction if signs of aggression occur distract the cats to separate them avoid getting between them or picking them up in that aroused state because redirected aggression may occur downloadopen in new tabdownload in powerpointfig 8 this cat has come to the clinic with its own familiar bedding courtesy of dr eliza sundahl where aggression is a potential concernif prior home comings have led to aggression or if there is a negative reaction after trying the above approach recommend that the client tries these steps put the patient in another safe quiet room with all necessary resources for at least 24 hours until the cats consistently respond to food and toy play from both sides of the door if problems continue after slow reintroduction for 3 days clients should seek veterinary advice regarding slower introduction or medication to facilitate the process often in these situations bringing the cats to the clinic together for future visits will prevent problems as both cats will carry the scent of the clinic 57 table 1 useful websites and online information for veterinary teams and or clientstable 1 useful websites and online information for veterinary teams and or clientsview larger versionsummary

surgical navigation using image overlays on the operative scene can be split into four main tasks calibration of the optical system registration of preoperative images to the patient system and patient tracking and display using a suitable visualization scheme to achieve a convincing result in the magnified microscope view a very high alignment accuracy is required the authors have simulated an entire image overlay system to establish the most significant sources of error and improved each of the stages involved the microscope calibration process has been automated the authors have introduced bone implanted markers for registration and incorporated a locking acrylic dental stent lads for patient tracking the lads can also provide a less invasive registration device with mean target error of 0 7 mm in volunteer experiments these improvements have significantly increased the alignment accuracy of the authors overlays phantom accuracy is 0 3 0 5 mm and clinical overlay errors were 0 5 1 0 mm on the bone fiducials and 0 5 4 mm on target structures the authors have improved the graphical representation of the stereo overlays the resulting system provides three

increases knowledge decreases decisional conflicts and regrets and improves post decision satisfaction emotional distress however few da trials have revealed whether decisional role preferences have an impact on patient reported outcomes by decision making the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of caregiver s decisional role preference on decisional conflicts and psychiatric distresses in decision making methods 406 of 444 caregivers of terminally ill cancer patients enrolled onto a previous trial determining the efficacy of the decision aid about disclosure of terminal disease status were included in this analysis the analysis outcomes were change score of decisional conflicts using the decision conflict scale dcs and depression and anxiety using the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads at 1 and 3 months from baseline participants were divided into 4 groups active caregiver who received da active da active caregiver in control group active control passive caregiver who received da passive da and passive caregiver in control group passive control linear mixed model was conducted to find out the impact of caregiver s decisional role preference on the dcs and the hads results among 406 caregivers 137 33 7 showed active role preference and 269 66 3 showed passive role preference in post hoc analysis of adjusted differences of change scores between passive da and active da groups non significant differences were observed in dcs however at 3 months change scores of hads depression subscale increased as 4 43 95 confidence interval ci 0 78 8 07 p 0 007 effect size es 0 71 and those of hads anxiety subscales increased as 4 14 95 ci 0 37 7 91 p 0 021 es 0 61 in passive da group than in active da group showing moderate to large difference

routine part of clinical care as a result secondary findings sequencing results that are medically actionable but unrelated to the reason for testing are also becoming more prevalent just how prevalent has been a subject of debate in this issue gordon and colleagues report the frequency of secondary findings sfs from a cohort of more than 21 000 participants in the national human genome research institute s electronic medical records and genomics emerge network the researchers developed a sequencing panel called emergeseq that includes 56 genes on the american college of medical genetics and genomics acmg s recommended list of reportable sfs as well as 11 additional genes and 14 variants in 11 more genes the panel was deployed at ten clinical sites across the united states in a diverse cohort the researchers identified 661 medically actionable findings that were unrelated to patients test indication yielding an overall sf frequency of 3 the great majority of sfs 84 were in variants in genes that the acmg recommends reporting most sfs were in cancer associated genes followed by cardiac disease and lipid disorder associated genes most cancer associated sfs were classified as pathogenic while cardiac associated sfs were likely pathogenic secondary findings were most prevalent in participants who self reported as caucasian white 3 1 followed by asian 2 7 black african american 2 3 hispanic latinx 2 and american indian alaska native or native pacific islander 1 3 however when the researchers excluded results from an allele known to be common only in those with european ancestry the frequency of sfs between those self reporting as white versus all other groups combined was no longer significant the researchers conclude that the findings offer an important resource for patients and research participants as well as facilitating the development of practice standards and guidelines in genomic medicine v l dengler news editorhow australia integrated genetic

ovarian cancer are referred to genetic counseling in australia genetic testing no longer requires referral to a genetics specialist instead oncology health professionals have taken up the process of testing and delivery of results o shea and colleagues investigated how genetic and oncology experts view making brca testing a routine part of oncology care for epithelial ovarian and breast cancer patients the researchers conducted semistructured telephone interviews with genetic counselors clinical geneticists nurses oncologists and a surgeon from rural metropolitan and statewide hospitals across australia the interviews which used an implementation science framework and consisted of 17 questions uncovered four themes that affected the implementation of mainstreaming brca testing first most participants found brca testing to be clinically useful as it offered patients further treatment options however they also pointed out a need for optimizing delivery of results and follow up second the interviews identified communication networks and role delineation as central components of implementation in particular participants cited a need for relationships between genetic counselors and oncologists as well clarity regarding providers patient responsibilities the interview results also revealed factors in sustaining routine testing including having ongoing training in genetics limited resources and funding and challenges in integrating public and private systems for sharing genetic information finally the interviews identified intervention characteristics influencing implementation for example most participants supported having a genetic counselor embedded in an oncology clinic as a version of mainstreaming however some interviewees indicated that funding and state health system structures might preclude this intervention the researchers conclude that the results will facilitate future research for guiding the integration of routine genetic testing in other cancer types v l dengler news editorauthorsv l denglerview author publicationsyou can also search for this author in pubmed google scholarrights and permissionsreprints and

However, conventional 180° radiofrequency pulses required to generate a spin echo are highly susceptible to the B(1) inhomogeneity at high magnetic fields such as 7 Tesla (7 T), resulting in varying signal and contrast over the region of interest. Adiabatic 180° pulses may be used to replace conventional 180° pulses in spin echo sequences to provide greater immunity to the inhomogeneous B(1) field at 7 T. However, because the spectral profile of an adiabatic 180° pulse has nonlinear phase, pairs of these pulses are needed for proper refocusing, resulting in increased radiofrequency power deposition and long minimum echo times. We used the adiabatic Shinnar Le-Roux method to generate a matched-phase adiabatic 90°-180° pulse pair to obviate the need for a second adiabatic 180° pulse for phase refocusing. The pulse pair was then reformulated into a single self-refocused pulse to minimize the echo time, and phantom and in vivo experiments were performed to validate pulse performance. The self-refocused adiabatic pulse produced transmit profiles that were substantially more uniform than those achieved using a conventional spin echo sequence.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

Most methods for clustering proteins are local, and are based on simply thresholding a measure related to sequence distance. We first show how locality limits the performance of such methods by analysing the distribution of distances between protein sequences. We then present a global method based on spectral clustering and provide theoretical justification of why it will have a remarkable improvement over local methods. We extensively tested our method and compared its performance with other local methods on several subsets of the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database, a gold standard for protein structure classification. We consistently observed that, the number of clusters that we obtain for a given set of proteins is close to the number of superfamilies in that set; there are fewer singletons; and the method correctly groups most remote homologs. In our experiments, the quality of the clusters as quantified by a measure that combines sensitivity and specificity was consistently better [on average, improvements were 84% over hierarchical clustering, 34% over Connected Component Analysis (CCA) (similar to GeneRAGE) and 72% over another global method, TribeMCL].", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

Chronic murine leukemia viruses often induce disease by insertional activation or mutation of cellular proto-oncogenes. These loci are identified as common viral integration sites in tumor DNAs. Here we report on the characterization of a novel common viral integration site in BXH-2 myeloid leukemias, designated Evi-2. Within the cluster of viral integration sites that define Evi-2, we identified a gene that has the potential for encoding a novel protein of 223 amino acids. This putative proto-oncogene possesses all of the structural features of a transmembrane protein. Within the transmembrane domain is a \"leucine zipper,\" suggesting that Evi-2 is involved in either homopolymer or heteropolymer formation, which may play an important role in the normal functioning of Evi-2. Interestingly, the human homolog of Evi-2 has recently been shown to be tightly linked to the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis locus, suggesting a role for Evi-2 in human disease as well.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

Contrary to this paradigm, we report here that transgenic mice lacking MHC class I expression and expressing an MHC class II I-A(b) molecule that presents only a single peptide (E alpha 52-68) spontaneously develops peripheral nervous system-specific autoimmune disease with many of the histopathological features found in experimental allergic neuritis. Reciprocal bone marrow chimeras produced using susceptible and resistant lines revealed that bone marrow-derived cells determined disease susceptibility. While the expression of the I-A(b)-E alpha 52-68 complex in the periphery was readily detectable in both lines, its expression on thymic dendritic cells responsible for tolerance induction was markedly lower in the susceptible line than in the resistant line. Consistent with this, CD4(+) T cells that can be activated by the I-A(b)-E alpha 52-68 complex were found in the susceptible line, but not in the resistant line. Such CD4(+) T cells conferred the disease to the resistant line by adoptive transfer, and administration of Ab specific for the I-A(b)-E alpha 52-68 complex inhibited disease manifestation in the susceptible line. These results indicate that disease development involves systemic T cell reactivity to I-A(b)-E alpha 52-68 complex, probably caused by incomplete negative thymocyte selection.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

and 32 dp210 bcr abl fusion gene mouse myeloid cell cell lines chronic myeloid leukemia cml is a myeloproliferative disorder that is characterized by philedelphia ph chromosome this chromosome is caused by resiprocal translocation t 9 22 q34 q11 2 which results in bcr abl fusion gene we hypothesized that garlic could cause apoptosis in cml cells therefore in this study it is aimed to investigate possible antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of garlic on 32dp210 bcr abl fusion gene mouse cml cell line and 32d wild type mouse myeloid cell line cell lines for this aim aqueous garlic extract 10 w v was added into the cell line media at 2 different final concentrations 0 4 and 1 at the 0 time and 24 48 and 72 hours later oxidant malondialdehyde mda level and xanthine oxidase xo activity and antioxidant superoxide dismutase sod glutathione peroxidase gsh px and catalase cat activities parameters were measured in the cell lines it was observed that the garlic extract caused no change in xo and antioxidant enzyme activities but increased mda level in the 32 d cell line however in the 32 dp210 cell line treated by the garlic extract significant increases in mda level 1 63 nmol million cells at 0 time vs 4 05 nmol million cells at the 72nd hour xo and antioxidant enzyme activities were found in conclusion it has been suggested that garlic directly causes oxidant stress in 32 d cell line owing to its own oxidant ingredients and that the oxidant stress created in 32 dp210 cell line owing to garlic treatment might occur through increased xo activity and or its own oxidant ingredients although antioxidant enzyme activities were found to increase in the 32 dp210 cell line it seemed that this compensatory change could not prevent the oxidant stress created the oxidant potential of garlic extract might play part in the possible anticancer property of the garlic which was supposed by several investigators top of page 2021 georg thieme verlag kg imprint

could be used as suicidal germination inducers in the absence of a host crop for the decontamination of land infested with parasitic weed seeds resultswe report the stereoselective synthesis of novel strigolactams together with some of their critical physicochemical properties such as water solubility hydrolytic stability as well as their short soil persistence in addition we show that such strigolactams are potent germination stimulants of o cumana parasitic weed seeds and do not affect the seed germination and the root growth of sunflower conclusionsthe novel strigolactam derivatives described here compare favourably with the corresponding gr 28 strigolactones in terms of biological activity and physicochemical properties however we believe strigolactone and strigolactam

methods eighty five stroke patients with depression conforming to the diagnoses standard of chinese classification of mental diseases 3rd edition ccmd 3 were treated with fluoxetine hydrochloride for 3 months and another 85 stroke patients without depression were selected as the control group the traits about n400 and blood platelet 5 ht concentrations of all patients were measured results there were significant differences between the incubation periods and average amplitudes of n400 in patients with psd and those in patients without psd p 0 01 while the blood platelet 5 ht concentrations of psd patients were much lower than those of the patients without psd p 0 01 for psd patients the n400 incubation periods were significantly shortened averaged amplitudes were significantly increased p 0 01 and the blood platelet 5 ht concentrations were significantly raised after 3 months treatment conclusions for erps n400 in psd patients the incubation period is significantly prolonged and the average amplitude is reduced blood platelet 5 ht concentration may influence erps n400 in psd patients significance n400 detections are helpful to the early diagnostic of psd and provide objective

total of 133 non diabetic men matched for age and body weight were reinvestigated after an average period of 3 1 2 years by means of oral glucose tolerance tests simultaneous insulin and c peptide measurements and submaximal work tests the number of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance did not increase during the observation period and none became diabetic intergroup differences in glucose and insulin values were largely the same as in the initial screening procedure although some regression towards the mean was observed the high insulin group compared with the low insulin group had overall higher glucose insulin and c peptide levels significantly higher increment 0 40 min of insulin but not c peptide and significantly lower maximal oxygen uptake the present data indicate no difference in insulin secretory capacity but a decreased hepatic insulin extraction and a peripheral insulin insensitivity among the high insulin responders related to a lower degree of physical

Q2WISE essentially is a hybrid between Q2TIPS and quantitative imaging of perfusion using a single subtraction II for use in specific absorption rate intensive applications. Q2WISE was implemented on a 3 T MRI scanner to measure perfusion rates in the brain and kidneys of eight healthy volunteers and results were compared with those from Q2TIPS. Mean perfusion values of both methods for the brain (75 ± 17 [Q2WISE] and 74 ± 13 mL/100 g/min [Q2TIPS]) and kidney (308 ± 48 [Q2WISE] and 299 ± 43 mL/100 g/min [Q2TIPS]) were in very good agreement.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

To develop alternative contrast agents without the presence of metal ions, liposomes were developed containing simple bioorganic and biodegradable compounds that produce diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer MR contrast. This diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer contrast is frequency-dependent, allowing the unique generation of \"multicolor\" images. The contrast can be turned on and off at will, and standard images do not show the presence of these agents. As an example, glycogen, L-arginine, and poly-L-lysine were encapsulated inside liposomes and injected intradermally into mice to image the lymphatic uptake of these liposomes. Using a frequency-dependent acquisition scheme, it is demonstrated that multicolor MRI can differentiate between different contrast particles in vivo following their homing to draining lymph nodes. Being nonmetallic and bioorganic, these diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer liposomes form an attractive novel platform for multicolor imaging in vivo.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

However, cross-calibration between the reference frames of the external tracking device and the MRI scanner can be tedious and remains a challenge in practical applications. In this study, we present two hybrid methods, both of which combine prospective, optical-based motion correction with retrospective entropy-based autofocusing to remove residual motion artifacts. Our results revealed that in the presence of cross-calibration errors between the optical tracking device and the MR scanner, application of retrospective correction on prospectively corrected data significantly improves image quality. As a result of this hybrid prospective and retrospective motion correction approach, the requirement for a high-quality calibration scan can be significantly relaxed, even to the extent that it is possible to perform external prospective motion tracking without any prior cross-calibration step if a crude approximation of cross-calibration matrix exists. Moreover, the motion tracking system, which is used to reduce the dimensionality of the autofocusing problem, benefits the retrospective approach at the same time.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

supporting information subjects rodent models get e alertsjournal of medicinal chemistryget e alertsabstractthe iaps are key regulators of the apoptotic pathways and are commonly overexpressed in many cancer cells iaps contain one to three bir domains that are crucial for their inhibitory function the pro survival properties of xiap come from binding of the bir domains to the pro apoptotic caspases the bir3 domain of xiap binds and inhibits caspase 9 while the bir2 domain binds and inhibits the terminal caspases 3 and 7 while xiap bir3 inhibitors have previously been reported they also inhibit ciap1 2 and promote the release of tnf potentially limiting their therapeutic utility this paper will focus on the optimization of selective xiap bir2 inhibitors leading to the discovery of highly potent benzodiazepinone 36 ic50 45 nm which has high levels of selectivity over xiap bir3 and ciap1 bir2 3 and shows efficacy in a xenograft pharmacodynamic model monitoring caspase activity while not

to host cells is mediated by fimh a mannose binding adhesin at the tip of bacterial type 1 pili to date utis are mainly treated with antibiotics leading to the ubiquitous problem of increasing resistance against most of the currently available antimicrobials therefore new treatment strategies are urgently needed here we describe the development of an orally available fimh antagonist starting from the carboxylate substituted biphenyl d mannoside 9 affinity and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters solubility permeability renal excretion were substantially improved by a bioisosteric approach with 3 chloro 4 d mannopyranosyloxy biphenyl 4 carbonitrile 10j a fimh antagonist with an optimal in vitro pk pd profile was identified orally applied 10j was effective in a

pressure in the pulmonary artery has a maximum valueof 20 mmhg 2 patients with values between 21 and 24mmhg borderline pulmonary hypertension should according to themost recent guidelines of the 3 european society of cardiology esc not be treated regular check ups are however necessary the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension can only be made usingresting measurements earlier definitions such as load inducedpulmonary hypertension are no longer valid according to thenewest studies 4 depending on pulmonary capillary wedgepressure pc and pulmonary vascular resistance pvr differenthemodynamic definitions of pulmonary hypertension exist withcorresponding clinical symptoms 5 pulmonary artery compliance cpa the transfer of pressure through the entire circulationand control of blood flow are necessary preconditions for thedevelopment of pulmonary circulation for these tasks to be fulfilledoptimally and taking into account the normally low pressure in thepulmonary circulation the pulmonary arteries must normally showhigh elasticity compliance 6 the relationship between pressureand volume called volume elasticity or arterial compliance is usedto describe this issue this is usually defined by the quotient compliance c stroke volume pulse pressure sv pp i where pulse pressure systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure this calculates the blood volume that can be accommodatedin a vessel with a predefined diameter at a known pressure an artery with high compliance is called an elastic artery one with lowcompliance is a stiff artery 7 8 the importance of compliance liesin the fact that an artery with high compliance can store a relativelylarge quantity of the blood expelled from the ventricle during thesystole and then release this volume in the diastole so that thereis a continuous flow into the pulmonary circulation 9 arterieswith low compliance do not have this ability and their contributionto the diastolic flow is small 6 7 compliance was already anessential element of the two element model 10 in the firstdescription of the arterial air vessel windkessel in the year 1899and was also used in the three 11 and four element windkesselmodel 10 these descriptions tried to explain how the arterialsystem worked the air vessel model of the pulmonary circulationis based on the function of a fire brigade air vessel figures 1 2 the pump heart conveys the water blood to the air vessel elastic artery the compressed air in the air vesssel was a storagefunction compliance which makes it possible to distribute thewater faster and with higher pressure figure 1 pressure volume relationship and example of thevascular reaction to different compliance as the vessel isfilled the cross sectional shape of the vessel changes fromoval to round reprint by courtesy of 8 a right eye andb left eye figure 2 comparison between the windkessel phenomenonin the cardiovascular system and the fire brigade sair vessel reprint by courtesy of 6 the change in compliance in pah is a more decisive factor inthe development of the prognosis and the treatment of the patients there are clinical 11 12 and experimental 13 indications that thereduction in compliance is a decisive parameter in the multifactorialgenesis of the disease the reduction occurs simultaneously withthe increase in pvr 7 therefore in contrast to the other vascularproperty s compliance is always reduced in patients with pah irrespective of the etiology of the pah 14 in order to understand the independent role of compliance better sajanet 15 examinedits relationship to the clinical evaluation and the symptoms ofpah they discovered that a reduction in compliance accompaniesthe increase of various hemodynamic parameters pam pvr rapressure and a worsening of resilience shorter distance walked inthe 6 minute walk test as well as being associated with an increasedlikelihood of an inpatient stay 15 an increase in compliance canbe achieved as a signof a hemodynamic improvement specializeddrug therapy with bosentan and sildenafil leads to an improvementin the sv pp ratio in pah patients together with an increase inresilience 16 pulmonary vascular resistance pvr vascular resistance is a quantitative description of therelationship between the pressure difference along the vessel andthe blood flow 6 although the resistance can be calculated withpoiseuille s law ohm s law is used in daily clinical practice 17 ii where r resistance p pressure difference q blood flow the result of applying this law for the pulmonary circulation isthe equation for pulmonary vascular resistance iii where pvr pulmonary vascular resistance pam averagepulmonary artery pressure pc pulmonary capillary wedgepressure co cardiac output resistance is a component of the two element windkesselmodel 17 and also remains in the three 11 and four elementwindkessel models 10 together with compliance and impedance it is one of the three elements on which the rv afterload depends 17 the pulmonary circulation resistance is significantly lowerin comparison with the systemic resistance it increases in pah 1 3 4 the clinical importance of this parameter has been knownfor a long time a value above six we in patients with terminal heartfailure and before heart transplantation is linked to an increasedprobability of acute right heart failure postoperatively up to 28 in the first three months 18 for this reason according to theinternational medical association guidelines pvr 6 we is anexclusion criterion for a heart transplant but not for a combinedheart lung transplant 19 the value particularly in the diagnosisand treatment of pah is unarguable not only is a pvr abovethree wood units a part of the definition 2 but this cut off valuecan also be used to distinguish between isolated post capillaryand mixed post and pre capillary pulmonary hypertension 3 therefore according to the most current european guidelines 3 the measurement of pvr is necessary for every right heartcatheter examination in addition there are signs that after a pointin the natural course of pah the rise in pvr becomes steeper 2 24 a decrease in pvr is considered an indicator of a patient shemodynamic improvement 7 9 14 although there is no clearlinear correlation with the clinical picture 14 18 water hammer phenomenona known phenomenon that occurs in every pump system withrapid change in flow due to valve opening and closing is the waterhammer 25 26 water hammer is a wave of pressure which dueto a rapid change in flow and the resulting changes happen dueto start stop of the pump and opening or closing of a valve theacute change of state of the pump and or valve result in a changein momentum defined as the product of mass x velocity of thefluid this change in momentum produces a shockwave whichunder certain circumstances causes damage in the pipes of thepump system the damage occurs when the applied force of theshockwaves overwhelms the elastic capacity of the pipes theeffects of such a phenomenon are not independent of the geometryof the pipe system for example when a water hammer wavereaches a bifurcation or an increase in cross sectional area there isa reduction in the amplitude of the wave with increased resistence or afterload in terms of hemodynamics there can be an increase inthe amplitude of the reflected wave of the water hammer especiallyin systems with a closed end in general under certain conditions water hammer pressure are multiplied 27 the mathematic equations describing this phenomenon are 25 26 u velocity p pressure t time x space f factor of viscosity b module of elasticity density and the modified equation is vi with pwv being pulse wave velocity this phenomenon is nothing more than a manifestation ofenergy transformation from kinetic to dynamic energy due to thedifferent compression ability between the fluid and the pipes ofthe pump system the enhanced pressure is transformed in extracompression of the pipe and therefore a higher initial velocity willproduce a more intense compression of the pipe wall the waterhammer phenomenon describes this dynamic change in a closepipe system when an acceleration or deceleration of the flowoccurs it plays a more significant role in pipe systems with lowpressure such as the pulmonary circulation 21 22 what correlations are there regarding the pulmonarycirculation the importance of pwv in the evaluation of arterial propertieshas been demonstrated by several studies 23 pwv is the mostvalidated method for noninvasively quantifying arterial stiffness it is regarded as the gold standard due to its simplicity reproducibility and clinical relevance 24 the definition is basically rational thesystolic period produces a pulse that leaves the ventricle and entersthe vascular system its velocity is the distance between two pointsof the cycle divided by time 21 increased arterial stiffness leadsto increased speed of the pulse wave in the artery 22 pwv iscalculated with the moens korteweg form pwv eh 2r vii eh is youngs modulus for elasticity the ratio stress strain ris the radius of the vessel measured in mm h is the wall thickness measured in mm and the blood density a relationship betweenpwv and compliance inversely proportional has also beendemonstrated 28 30 this means that a stiff artery leads the pulsewave much faster compared to an elastic artery the significanceof arterial stiffness is undoubtedly proven it is an independentrisk factor for the development of coronary heart disease hr 1 23 95 ci 1 11 to 1 35 an ischemic stroke hr 1 28 95 ci 1 16 to1 42 and peripheral arterial disease hr 1 30 95 ci 1 18 to 1 43 and has statistical significant correlation with cardiovascular hr1 28 95 ci 1 15 to 1 43 and total mortality hr 1 17 95 ci 1 11to 1 22 27 kaess et al 28 further investigated the correlationbetween stiffness and blood pressure and found that although thepresence of stiffness is associated with an increased probabilityof developing hypertension the development of arterial stiffnessremains independent 28 according to vii pwv and the rate of change of pressure ofthe artery dp dt are proportional two processes are responsiblefor this a the elastin and collagen deposits in the extracellularmatrix which shift the power deformation curve f curve tothe left 29 b and the particularly in pah increased right ventricularstress which is transmitted into the pa 30 the presence of the water hammer phenomenon in the arterialsystem and the human body has been previously mentioned andused vennin et al 31 have accomplished to deliver the aorticpressure from the aortic flow using the above equations and haraldet al 32 have confirmed the measurements in vivo the mathematicdependency of pwv and dp dt has also been experimentally proven 33 35 at this point it should be further analyzed which role hasthe arterial stiffness in the pulmonary circulation elasticity is theproperty that permits the transformation of the wall due to anapplied force and by withdrawing of this force the wall returns toits initial shape this is not the case in the human cardiovascularsystem as the arterial walls are not elastic but viscoelastic thismeans that a rapid application of force has more loss of energy thana slow one 6 this is because a larger rate of change of pressuremeans greater applied force which results a greater velocity ofstretch and therefore greater viscosity this increase in viscosity means that a greater energy loss is taking place during the systolicperiod and that the ventricle must produce a greater energy in orderto retain the same stroke volume due to the viscoelastic nature ofthe human arteries the increased stiffness of the pulmonary arteryin patients with pulmonary hypertension the presence of the waterhammer cannot be excluded what is the meaning of the water hammer in pulmonaryhypertension the current treatment of pah can be divided into three levels general measures supportive therapy and targeted specific pahtreatment general measures should be understood as the avoidanceof pregnancy routine influenza and pneumococcal vaccination avoiding travel in altitudes over 1500 to 2000 m psychosomatic psychological and social patient counselling the supportivemeasures include the administration of diuretics for signs of rightcardiac decompensation oxygen therapy at po2 60 mmhg andiron replacement in cases of iron deficiency anemia targetedpah treatment consisting of endothelin receptor antagonists phosphodiesterasetype 5 inhibitors guanylate cyclase stimulatorsand the prostanoids aim to vasodilatation increase of the vesselelasticity reduction of the vascular resistance and improvement ofthe right ventricular function 36 37 in engineering however thetreatment of the water hammer cannot be the increase of the pipeelasticity since the elastic properties of pipes in a given system canno longer be changed and the following methods are used theinstallation of a by pass pipe with a non return valve it does notprevents the water hammer effect but it can reduce the magnitudeof the water hammer wave a reduction approximately of 33 can be achieved 38 another alternative is the surge tanks in piping system these tanksact as a reservoir to suppress the pressure waves and are installedon the discharge pipe when the pressure in the pipe increases adense fluid enters the tank and is stored locally during periods ofsubnormal pressure in the pipe the fluid would flow back to thepipe preventing rapid velocity changes 38 finally the installationof air chambers air chambers are basically a type of high pressuresurge tanks which can be built in small sizes in these tanks thepressurized air locates on the top of liquid separately the size ofthe chamber must be large enough to compensate the liquid in thesubnormal pressure periods 38 among water hammer dampingdevices air chambers are often used to reduce pressure surgesof system to acceptable values the chamber is more effective if athrottling device is used resulting in a reduction of the requiredvolume 39 although the application of such methods in thehuman body seems difficult and problematic a proper use couldbe an alternative in patients where the medical treatment is nolonger sufficient and a transplantation is not a suitable option experimental and clinical studies are obviously necessary in orderto move in a such direction conclusionwater hammer seems to be also manifest in the pulmonaryartery of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension

However, their therapeutic application demands a scaffold with appropriate properties. HydroMatrix (HydM) is a novel injectable peptide nanofiber hydrogel developed recently for cell culture. Our aim was to test whether HydM would be a suitable scaffold for proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. PDLSCs were seeded on non-coated or HydM-coated surfaces. Both real-time impedance analysis and cell viability assay documented cell growth on HydM. PDLSCs showed healthy, fibroblast-like morphology on the hydrogel. After a 3-week-long culture in osteogenic medium, mineralization was much more intense in HydM cultures compared to control. Alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells grown on the gels reached the non-coated control levels. Our data provided evidence that PDLSCs can adhere, survive, migrate, and proliferate on HydM and this gel also supports their osteogenic differentiation. We first applied impedimetry for dental stem cells cultured on a scaffold. HydM is ideal for ", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

Traditionally, models of spinal circuits have emphasized the role of inhibition in enforcing reciprocal alternation between left and right sides or flexors and extensors. However, recent work has shown that inhibition also increases coincident with excitation during contraction. Here, using larval zebrafish, we investigate the V2b (Gata3+) class of neurons, which contribute to flexor-extensor alternation but are otherwise poorly understood. Using newly generated transgenic lines we define two stable subclasses with distinct neurotransmitter and morphological properties. These V2b subclasses synapse directly onto motor neurons with differential targeting to speed-specific circuits. In vivo, optogenetic manipulation of V2b activity modulates locomotor frequency: suppressing V2b neurons elicits faster locomotion, whereas activating V2b neurons slows locomotion. We conclude that V2b neurons serve as a brake on axial motor circuits. Together, these results indicate a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

diseases understanding the activation mechanism of these receptors is thus of high clinical relevance we investigated vascular endothelial growth factors vegfs and their receptors vegfrs which regulate blood and lymph vessel formation we analyzed the structural changes in the extracellular receptor domain that were induced by ligand binding and that represent the initial step in transmembrane signaling culminating in the activation of the intracellular receptor kinase domain high resolution structural information for the ligand binding domain became available recently but the flexibility of the extracellular domain and inhomogeneous glycosylation of vegfrs have prevented the production of highly diffracting crystals of the entire extracellular domain so far therefore we chose to further investigate vegfr structure by small angle x ray scattering in solution saxs saxs data were combined with independent distance restraint determination obtained by mass spectrometric analysis of chemically cross linked ligand receptor complexes with these data we constructed a structural model of the entire extracellular receptor domain in the unbound form and in complex with vegf

are activated by soluble extracellular ligands by extracellular matrix components or by membrane bound molecules forming cell cell contacts and are thus essential regulators of tissue architecture activation is initiated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain ecd followed by structural rearrangements that lead to receptor dimerization or in some cases to the formation of higher order multimers 2 dimerization leads to the activation of the intracellular kinase domain and subsequent signaling to a plethora of membrane bound and cytoplasmic signaling molecules with the application of high throughput structural analysis we have gained structural information for a wide variety of rtks however most structures comprise only distinct subdomains such as the ecd or truncated versions of the intracellular kinase domain high resolution structural information of a complete rtk in the active and the inactive conformation is still missing here we investigate the structural basis of receptor kinase activation of the clinically highly relevant vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor family which regulates vessel formation in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis 3 vegfrs are type v rtks consisting of 7 extracellular immunoglobulin homology domains ig domains and a split intracellular kinase domain a high resolution crystallographic structure is available for ig domains 2 and 3 d23 of vegfr 2 in complex with vegf c 4 comparison of this structure with other vegfs shows that loops l1 l2 and l3 and the amino terminal helix determine receptor specificity 5 11 vegfs interact with ig domains 2 and 3 and the interdomain linker of the receptor ecd a crystallographic structure of the membrane proximal ig domain 7 d7 revealed the residues maintaining homotypic d7 d7 contacts in the ligand bound form of the receptor 12 at present no high resolution structure of the full length ecd is available however a low resolution structure of the entire ecd was obtained using negative stain single particle electron microscopy em 13 the published em structure allowed us to determine the overall shape of this ligand receptor complex and led us to postulate homotypic contacts between ig domains 4 and 7 which might further stabilize receptor dimers in the active conformation the role of these membrane proximal domains in receptor activation is supported by a high resolution structure of the related type iii receptor c kit 14 and by functional data for vegfr 2 12 vegfr 3 15 and pdgf receptor 16 the aim of the current study was to confirm the em structure using a large ensemble of molecular complexes in solution and to gain further insights into the structure of the ecd of vegfr 2 in the absence and presence of bound ligand x ray crystallography is the gold standard for structure determination of such protein complexes however purified material often does not crystallize or gives rise to poorly diffracting crystals in addition crystallographic structure analysis requires proteins to associate with each other through crystal contacts impeding the flexibility of proteins prevailing in solution the receptor ecd studied here is flexible 13 and highly glycosylated and we therefore chose small angle solution x ray scattering saxs for further structural analysis 17 19 to corroborate the observed arrangement of the intramolecular and the intermolecular contacts between the different subdomains in ligand bound receptors revealed by our structural models we performed an independent distance restraint analysis receptor monomers and ligand receptor complexes were subjected to chemical cross linking of lysine residues followed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric ms analysis 20 21 taken together the data shown here allowed us to visualize the entire ecd in solution show that ligand binding promotes the formation of a rigid and stable complex and determine major structural changes in the receptor ecd induced by ligand binding the existing high resolution structures were shown to fit into the envelope modeled from the solution scattering data confirming our earlier published em receptor ecd structure 13 materials and methods protein

a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm was used for matching of fragment ions tolerances of 0 2 da for common ions and 0 3 da for cross link ions were used all cross linked peptides identified with a linear discriminant ld score 25 were considered for manual validation in which the identified ms ms spectra were reviewed for matching ion series on both cross linked peptide chains and for matching of the most abundant peaks to determine the absence or presence of a cross linked peptide in a sample where a cross link was not sequenced we manually inspected the ms1 data for the presence of a corresponding precursor using a retention time window of 5 min results saxs analysis of receptor complexessaxs data for vegf c vegfa121 vegfr 2 ecd and complexes between the ligands and the receptor ecd were collected at the csaxs beamline at the sls and are shown in fig 1 and tables 1 and 2 the scattering pattern of vegfr 2 ecd in complex with vegfa121 was found to be very similar to that of the complex with vegf c supplemental fig s1a the intensity curves fig 1a and distance distribution functions fig 1b for these samples reveal the relative sizes and shapes of the proteins in solution vegf c was clearly the smallest of all proteins measured the distance distribution function and shape reconstructions with dammif and gasbor 24 showed a globular slightly flattened shape for vegf c fig 1c the unliganded vegfr 2 ecd was mono meric and had an elongated shape in solution fig 1c the kratky plot supplemental fig s1b suggested moderate interdomain flexibility independent shape reconstructions by dammif yielded elongated clearly bent shapes of the protein complexes which could easily be aligned fig 1c the scattering profile of the vegfr 2 ecd vegf c complex indicated that its mass was about twice the mass of the receptor ecd alone and the maximum of the distance distribution function was shifted toward higher distances compared to the monomeric vegfr 2 ecd showing that in the dimeric receptor the main body is thicker than in the monomeric receptor fig 1a b we also noted that the maximum dimension of the complex is 60 longer than the receptor monomer suggesting that dimerization induced by ligand binding straightens the bent monomeric receptor the shape reconstructions with dammif indicated an elongated structure where one end contains more mass than the other apparently representing the ligand binding ig domains d2 and d3 of the protein complex the filtered average model is shown in fig 1c the shape reconstructions were run without symmetry restraints and therefore the resulting models are not symmetric shape reconstructions using p2 symmetry fit the data equally well with similar 2 values however in 6 of 20 of the models calculated the axis of symmetry was positioned across instead of along the chains the averaged model from the p2 reconstructions with correctly positioned axis was similar to the p1 model in size and in its overall features and symmetry was clearly visible in the first three domains rigid body modeling see supplemental data for details of this complex was demanding because of the large number of domains with unknown structures and the resulting models showed clear deviations from the data supplemental fig s2 chemical cross linking and mass spectrometric analysisthe chemical cross linking results for the unliganded vegfr 2 ecd and the vegfr 2 ecd vegf c and vegf a121 complexes are shown in fig 2 the sds page analysis under reducing conditions showed that cross linking led to broadening of the bands because of the addition of a random number of cross linkers to each protein molecule fig 2a the unliganded vegfr 2 ecd remained monomeric even after cross linking while the formation of covalently cross linked ligand receptor complexes was observed by the appearance of a broad band at a higher apparent molecular weight fig 2a ms analysis of the cross linked peptides after tryptic digestion is shown in fig 2b the left panel of fig 2b shows a graphic representation of the cross links identified in the unliganded vegfr 2 ecd while the lysine residues involved in the crosslinks are shown in the right panel of fig 2a here as with the vegf a and vegf c complexes most of the cross links were formed between lysine residues in ig domains 2 5 and the majority of the contacts were within a subdomain or between adjacent subdomains in the ligand receptor complexes additional cross links were observed between the receptor domain 3 peptide dlktqsemk and the carboxyterminal part of the ligand arqencdkpr in the vegfr 2 ecd vegf a121 complex and within the ligand most of the cross links observed in the ligand receptor complexes could also be identified in the unliganded receptor after manual ms data analysis on the other hand some of the cross links observed in the unliganded receptor were not detected in the complexes the right panel of fig 2b displays the cross links that formed in the unliganded receptor but not in the complexes the most notable difference to the unliganded receptor was the reduction of cross links between domain 1 and domains 2 and 3 only one of the original d1 d2 cross links was observed also in the complexes this remaining cross link residue 38 shows that the absence of cross links was not caused by the inaccessibility of the lysine residues to the cross linking reagent after ligand binding but arises from a conformational change between the unliganded and the ligand bound receptor structural model buildingthe interpretation of the saxs results was verified by docking the crystal structures of the vegfr 2 d23 vegf c 4 complex and of vegfr 2 d7 12 into the saxs derived molecular envelope the envelope used for this purpose was the most typical of the independent shape reconstructions as determined by damaver 24 instead of the averaged shape reconstruction shown in fig 1c the ligand binding domain consisting of ig domains 2 and 3 in complex with vegf c 4 was docked into the ab initio shape reconstruction using the program situs 26 the program found 4 unique solutions figure 3 shows the best fitting docking orientation the domain 7 crystallographic structure 12 was docked into the saxs envelope manually the saxs derived envelope with the fitted crystallographic structures is shown in fig 3 figure 3open in figure viewermost typical saxs envelope of the vegfr 2 ecd vegf c complex with the crystal structures of ig domains 2 and 3 with vegf c 2x1w pdb chains cdlo and of domain 7 3kvq pdb docked inside orientation is the same as in fig 1c discussiona variety of techniques is available today for the structural analysis of large protein complexes single particle electron microscopy x ray crystallography or solution scattering using neutrons sans or x rays saxs are widely used additional information on protein complexes is acquired with biochemical techniques such as chromatographic analysis or chemical cross linking the choice of the technique depends on the protein complex to be analyzed here we studied vegf ligand receptor complexes using saxs and chemical cross linking followed by proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry this combination allowed us to determine the low resolution structure of the entire ecd of the receptor in solution both in the unliganded and ligand bound form and to pinpoint the major structural changes taking place on ligand binding small angle x ray scattering probes a large ensemble of molecules and therefore averages over all the conformations present in solution this is in contrast to single molecule electron microscopy where a much smaller number of individual particles are analyzed shape categorized and averaged in addition saxs avoids possible problems arising from the deposition and negative staining of single particles on em grids that might affect the overall structure of the particles saxs is therefore a technique complementing single particle em and most important delivers data on molecular structures in solution which are difficult to obtain with other methods previous em studies indicated that the monomeric vegfr 2 ecd is flexible since averaging of the shapes of single particles was impossible 13 our saxs results suggest a more moderate flexibility and a defined bent shape for the unliganded receptor similar moderate flexibility and a bent structure were reported earlier for a 6 ig domain fragment of the elastic i band section of titin 27 and for the 5 ig domain structure of the c kit ecd 14 however interdomain flexibility is difficult to interpret from saxs data alone 28 and the ab initio envelope obtained by modeling represents an average structure of a dynamic multidomain protein 28 in the absence of ligand only monomeric receptor was observed in solution even after cross linking dimerization of the receptor in solution is thus strictly ligand dependent this differs from epidermal growth factor receptor a type i rtk which has been shown to form dimers of finite lifetime in live cells also in the absence of ligand 29 30 whether predimerized vegfrs exist in live cells under physiological conditions remains at present unclear our own data using coimmunoprecipitation 31 and chemical receptor cross linking indicate that vegfr 2 does not form stable dimers in the absence of ligand in live cells unpublished results the saxs results presented here show that ligand binding and dimerization alter the conformation of the receptor ecd drastically resulting in reorientation of individual ig domains the final structure is very similar to our previous em structure 13 the presented chemical cross linking data further reveal that the major conformational change promoted by ligand binding is the reorientation of domain 1 relative to domains 2 and 3 the vegf c and vegf a121 receptor ecd complexes showed virtually identical saxs intensity curves similarly the protein contact sites deduced from the cross linking experiments show that these complexes are topologically very similar thus we conclude that the specific ligand receptor interactions give rise to similar overall shapes of the two receptor complexes the shape reconstructions figs 1c and 3 suggest that domain 1 might be positioned in an asymmetric manner with different volumes adjacent to the ligand binding domains although we cannot completely exclude that this is an artifact arising from shape reconstructions in p1 symmetry it could also reflect a moderate flexibility of receptor ecd ig domain 1 our data support the idea that the two receptor chains are oriented in parallel and are possibly intertwined in ig domains 4 7 in the membrane proximal part of the receptor ecd additional high resolution structures derived from crystallographic data and or structural information from single molecule cryo em tomography are now required to address the issue of domain 1 flexibility and to define the exact orientation of receptor ecd monomers in ligand bound dimers the authors thank the swiss national science foundation grant 3100a 116507 and oncosuisse grant oc2 01200 08 2007 for continuous support of their work this

Human alpha-, gamma- and zeta-thrombins, as well as bovine trypsin, readily hydrolyse Spectrozyme-TH (D-hexahydrotyrosyl-Ala-Arg p-nitroanilide) at pH 7.4 and approx. 23 degrees C. Both alpha- and zeta-thrombins, which have high fibrinogen-clotting activities (greater than 3000 kunits/g), were inhibited with this substrate by hirulog-1 [Ki = 2.56 +/- 0.35 nM (n = 3) and 1.84 +/- 0.15 nM (n = 3) respectively] and slowly cleaved the inhibitor [k = 0.326 +/- 0.082 min-1 (n = 12) and 0.362 +/- 0.056 min-1 (n = 18) respectively], whereas gamma-thrombin, which has essentially no clotting activity (approx. 4 kunits/g), and trypsin were not inhibited with greater than 1000-fold molar excess of hirulog-1. Similar inhibition parameters were also obtained for hirulog-1 incubated with alpha-thrombin or zeta-thrombin at approx. 23 degrees C and by measuring thrombin activity with fibrinogen in the clotting assay at 37 degrees C. Cleavage of the Arg-3-Pro-4 bond in hirulog-1 by either alpha- or zeta-thrombin was shown by identical cleavage products of either thrombin on h.p.l.c. and by sequence analysis of the alpha-thrombin products. These data demonstrate that hirulog-1 is a specific inhibitor of thrombin forms with high fibrinogen-procoagulant activities and that its Arg-3-Pro-4 bond is slowly cleaved by these thrombin forms.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

auditory hallucinations ah however results from large sample trials are needed to confirm these results in a relatively large sample size this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial investigates the efficacy of tdcs on auditory hallucinations general symptomology of psychotic disorders as well as cognitive functioning methodsfifty four patients with treatment resistant ah received twice daily 2 ma tdcs or sham treatment for 20 minutes on five consecutive days the anode was placed on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the cathode at the left temporoparietal junction symptom severity was measured at four different time points investigating initial effects and their duration up to three months after treatment symptoms were assessed using the auditory hallucination rating scale ahrs positive and negative syndrome scale panss the stroop task and the trail making test adverse events were assessed using the tdcs adverse effects questionnaire resultstotal ahrs scores decreased significantly over time from on average 28 4 sd 5 3 to 26 6 sd 7 0 p 01 as well as more general symptomatology measured by the total p 01 and general p 01 subscale of the panss however there was no significant interaction effect with the treatment group on these measures both groups showed similar decreases over time there was a statistically significant trend towards participants completing the trail making test faster after active treatment p 09 compared to placebo but not the stroop task there were no significant differences between the groups in adverse events discussionthe current study found no efficacy of tdcs for treatment resistant hallucinations compared to placebo the findings suggest that cognitive improvement due to anodal dlpfc stimulation may be possible these results call for new strategies in using tdcs as a treatment for hallucinations advances in fundamental tdcs studies may help adapt treatment parameters and targeting methods to obtain stronger results future work may aim at identifying patient characteristics that predict higher chances of success pdf this content is only available as a pdf the author s 2019 published by

Cadherins and RhoGTPases are critical molecular players that regulate adhesions and motility during initial delamination of NCCs from the neuroepithelium. Recent studies have revealed multiple functions for these molecules and suggest that a precise balance of their activity is crucial. RhoGTPase appears to regulate both cell adhesions and protrusive forces during NCC delamination. Increasing evidence shows that cadherins are multi-functional proteins with novel, adhesion-independent signaling functions that control NCC motility during both delamination and migration. These functions are often regulated by specific proteolytic cleavage of cadherins.

To the best of our knowledge, the promising data regarding the developmental toxicity of guaifenesin are scarce. The current study investigates the developmental toxic effects of guaifenesin in detail using female rats.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five dams were divided into five groups. Group 1 served as a control, while Group-2, -3, -4, and -5 were administered with 250, 350, 500, and 600 (mg/kg b.w.) doses of guaifenesin, respectively, starting from gestation day 6 to day 17. Half of the total recovered fetuses was subjected to morphologic and morphometric analysis, while other half was subjected to skeletal examination.\nRESULTS: A significant reduction in maternal weight, and food/water intake, was observed, however, no mortality and morbidity were observed. About 14 dead fetuses were found in Group-3 and -4 each, while 26 in Group 5. Morphological analysis revealed 21.2%, 45.4%, 67.2%, and 86.9% of total fetuses having hemorrhagic spots in Group-2, -3, -4, and -5, respectively. Dropping wrist/ankle and kinky tail were found in Group-4 and -5 only. Morphometric analysis showed a significant decline in fetal weight, full body length, skull length, forelimb length, hindlimb length, and tail length in all guaifenesin treated groups. Skeletal examination displayed that only Group 5 fetuses had increased intercostal space between 7(th) and 8(th) rib. We also observed improper development of carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, and metatarsals of the Group 5 fetuses.\nCONCLUSION: Guaifenesin showed a significant developmental toxicity at selected test doses; therefore, a careful use is suggested during pregnancy.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

gp120 produced in bhk 21 cells did not significantly reduce their ability to bind to cd4 the cellular receptor for the virus because recombinant proteins may behave differently from proteins present on virions we investigated whether such viral envelope glycoproteins either in a purified form or present on viral particles could be deglycosylated by treatment with an endoglycosidase f n glycanase mixture which cleaves all accessible glycan moieties endoglycosidase analysis of the carbohydrate composition of purified viral gp120 vgp120 indicated a glycosylation pattern similar to that for recombinant gp120 rgp120 and treatment with endoglycosidase f n glycanase resulted in comparable molecular weight mw reduction for both molecules similarly after immunoblotting of the deglycosylated viral preparation the characteristic 160 and 120 kilodalton kda bands were replaced by 90 and 60 kda bands respectively the apparent mw of gp41 shifted to 35 kda these results are consistent with complete deglycosylation the immunoreactive conformation of envelope glycoproteins remained unaltered after deglycosylation they were recognized to the same extent by specific human polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies and no proteolysis of viral proteins occurred during enzymatic treatment deglycosylation of vgp120 resulted in a less than 10 fold reduction of the ability to bind to cd4 presented either in a soluble form or at the cell membrane in addition deglycosylation significantly reduced but did not abolish hiv 1 binding to and infectivity of cd4 cells as determined respectively by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and a quantitative dose response infection assay taken together these results indicate that removal of glycans present on mature envelope glycoproteins of hiv 1 diminishes but does not abolish either virus binding to cd4 or its capacity to infect cd4 cells previousnext back to top download pdf citation tools print reprints and

the associations between multidimensional tobacco dependence and youths asthma status with gender as an effect modifier backgrounddespite the adverse respiratory effects some adolescents with asthma smoke tobacco girls and boys have been shown to have different motivations for tobacco use methodssecondary analyses were conducted of data obtained from 1248 adolescents who completed the british columbia youth survey of smoking and health ii the sample was limited to youth who reported current or experimental tobacco use and who provided asthma status information tobacco dependence was assessed with the modified fagerstr m tolerance questionnaire and four dimension adolescents need for smoking scale anss which assesses social dependence physical dependence emotional dependence and sensory dependence on tobacco all analyses were stratified by gender resultsthe sample was 535 boys and 713 girls who were 15 9 years of age sd 1 5 on average gender was associated with both self reported asthma status and the physical dependence dimension of the anss multiple linear regression analyses revealed that girls with asthma compared with girls without asthma had higher physical tobacco dependence scores after adjusting for demographic and other factors none of the tobacco dependence dimensions was associated with the asthma status of boys conclusionsasthmatic girls who report smoking may be doing so because they develop physical dependence relatively quickly and lose their autonomy with respect to tobacco use they may require significant support for smoking

phage assay was 0 93 map cells per 50 ml milk which was better than both pms qpcr and pms culture when individual milks n 146 and bulk tank milk btm n 22 obtained from johne s affected herds were tested by the pms phage assay viable map were detected in 31 21 2 of 146 individual milks and 13 59 1 of 22 btm with map numbers detected ranging from 6 948 plaque forming units per 50 ml milk pms qpcr and pms mgit culture proved to be less sensitive tests than the pms phage assay conclusionsthe optimized pms phage assay is the most sensitive and specific method available for the detection of viable map in milk further work is needed to streamline the pms phage assay because the assay s multistep format currently makes it unsuitable for adoption by the dairy industry as a screening test significance and impact of the studythe inclusivity ability to detect all map strains specificity ability to detect only map and detection sensitivity ability to detect low numbers of map of the optimized pms phage assay have been comprehensively demonstrated for the first time introductionmycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis map is the causative agent of johne s disease jd a chronic enteric wasting disease primarily affecting domestic ruminants stabel 1998 sweeney 2011 infected animals shed the pathogen in their faeces and milk jd is found throughout the world and many different estimates of herd prevalence have been reported manning and collins 2001 tiwari et al 2006 wilson et al 2010 however the true prevalence of jd among farmed animals is unknown and because of limitations of current methodologies for the detection of map levels of map infection reported are likely to be underestimates in many cases a study carried out by nielsen and toft 2009 reviewed many prevalence studies carried out across europe and concluded that the prevalence of jd is likely to be 50 in many european countries there is some evidence to suggest an association between map and various chronic long term human disorders including crohn s disease cd irritable bowel syndrome type 1 diabetes t1dm multiple sclerosis ms and more recently hiv infection sarcoidosis and hashimoto thyroiditis waddel et al 2015 although the role of map in the development or progression of any of these human diseases is still unclear recent meta analysis studies demonstrated a significant association with at least three of these human disorders including cd feller et al 2007 waddel et al 2015 timms et al 2016 t1dm and ms waddel et al 2015 uncertainty about the role of map as a human pathogen still remains and there is general consensus within the food safety community that human exposure to map should be minimized as a precautionary measure consumption of milk and possibly meat from infected animals is currently viewed as a potential source of zoonotic transmission of the pathogen from animals to humans map has been isolated from retail milk and dairy products in many parts of the world grant et al 2002 ayele et al 2005 ellingson et al 2005 carvalho et al 2012 paolicchi et al 2012 suggesting that the pathogen can enter the human food chain and that current high temperature short time pasteurization may not always ensure complete inactivation of this pathogenic bacterium traditional cultural methods cannot be routinely adopted to demonstrate the presence of viable map in milk because the methods are time consuming not specific and lack sensitivity slana et al 2008a indeed chemical decontamination applied before culture to inactivate the competitive flora has been proven to have a detrimental effect on the viability of map grant et al 2003 gao et al 2005 and also to extend the time required for primary isolation a number of molecular tests including both conventional and quantitative pcr methods have been successfully developed to permit faster detection of map in milk timms et al 2011 however most of these tests do not provide information about the viability of detected cells and their sensitivity is generally affected by nonmycobacterial dna protein and pcr inhibitors present in test samples unless laborious dna extraction methods are applied before dna amplification timms et al 2015 we recently combined an optimized phage amplification assay foddai et al 2009 with selective peptide mediated magnetic separation pms foddai et al 2010b to achieve a rapid novel detection test for viable map the pms phage method exploits the use of d29 mycobacteriophage and is able to provide rapid enumeration of viable map in milk and veterinary samples within 48 h foddai et al 2011 based on the number of plaques lysis areas produced on a lawn of fast growing mycobacterium smegmatis more recently an optimized milk sample preparation protocol to maximize accuracy of map counts when testing cows milk was described foddai and grant 2015 the aims of the present study were i to assess inclusivity and specificity of the recently optimized pms phage assay by testing a large number of map strains and other bacterial milk isolates ii to compare the limit of detection 50 lod50 of the optimized pms phage assay with those of pms culture and pms qpcr targeting both is900 and f57 by testing artificially contaminated milk samples and iii to test individual raw milk samples and bulk tank milk btm from dairy herds affected

demonstrate the presence of viable map in test samples however the method is time consuming takes weeks to yield results and any map counts obtained are going to be underestimates due to the inclusion of a chemical decontamination step prior to culture which can adversely impact map viability there is interest among dairy producers and processors to identify a rapid method that could be adopted to detect the presence of map in raw milk from primary suppliers and dairy products produced from this milk the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of an already described pms phage assay foddai et al 2011 for the rapid detection of viable map in cows milk that has undergone further optimization over recent years foddai and grant 2015 the method exploits the ability of d29 mycobacteriophage to replicate and amplify within only viable mycobacterial cells and represents an optimized version foddai et al 2009 2010a of the commercially phage based test fastplaquetb assay biotec laboratories limited ipswich uk which was originally developed for the rapid detection of viable m tuberculosis in order to maximize specificity of detection the phage amplification assay is applied after selective capture of map cells on paramagnetic beads coated with two selective anti map peptide binders foddai et al 2010b to date only results of pms phage assay testing of a limited number of naturally contaminated btm n 44 and faeces n 39 samples have been reported providing proof of concept for the pms phage assay foddai et al 2011 further refinements to the milk testing procedure mostly related to optimizing milk sample preparation prior to pms have been made since 2011 therefore this study was carried out to assess inclusivity specificity and detection sensitivity of an optimized version of the pms phage assay and to compare this assay with pms culture and pms qpcr inclusivity of a microbiological test is the ability to detect the target micro organism within a wide range of bacterial strains prior to this study a limited range of map strains had been tested by pms and also by the phage amplification assay foddai et al 2009 2010a b a much broader range of map strains n 43 isolated from various sources animals milk water and humans was tested as part of this study to demonstrate inclusivity for map of the two peptide binders amp3 and amptd involved in the pms and of the d29 mycobacteriophage involved in the phage amplification assay the observation of plaques when the map strains were tested demonstrated that all strains were successfully infected by d29 mycobacteriophage and this finding confirmed 100 inclusivity for map although some variability in pfu counts was observed similar plaque counts were observed for the vast majority 93 of map strains tested this also suggests that consistent capture was being achieved by the two peptide binders during pms due to the hydrophobic nature of its cell wall map cells tend to aggregate in clumps the presence of which impacts accurate enumeration of viable map cells in tested samples the appearance of the map broths before testing visibly differed between strains likely due to variations in clump size and distribution and even after declumping some broths still showed visible clumps that had not been fully dispersed these observations might explain the variability in pfu counts observed for different map cultures and lower pfu counts may have resulted due to counting of clumps of cells rather than just single cells conversely map cultures that contained larger clumps that were effectively dispersed into single cells by ultrasonication treatment would yield higher pfu counts which was apparently the case for map strains nctc 8578 307r and van veen 52991 1 in the case of map strains showing particularly large standard deviations in fig 1 the efficiency of the declumping step has clearly differed more between the duplicate map suspensions tested for these strains compared to the other map strains tested the latter finding suggests that different degrees of declumping were being achieved by the ultrasonication treatment applied before pms thus ultrasonication conditions for map declumping purposes may need further optimization in relation to specificity this study assessed if the d29 mycobacteriophage involved in the phage assay was capable of infecting other mycobacterium sp or other raw milk bacteria which might potentially lead to the formation of plaques in the absence of map when the method is used to test milk samples a previous study carried out by rybniker et al 2006 reported that the d29 mycobacteriophage can infect various mycobacterium sp including m smegmatis m tuberculosis m bovis bcg m avium m scrofulaceum and m ulcerans whereas it was unable to infect m marinum m fortuitum and m chelonae the assay used in this study was modified for map based on its specific burst time which was found to be longer than for other mycobacterium sp foddai et al 2009 as cell lysis is dependent on the host s generation time the d29 phage requires a longer time 220 min within map cells to replicate and release the new phage progeny than in other faster growing mycobacterium sp the burst time of which generally ranges between 1 and 2 h david et al 1980 consequently the virucidal treatment applied after 2 h of incubation with d29 bacteriophage would have no detrimental effect against phage particles still to be released from map cells whereas it inactivates any progeny phage already released from faster growing mycobacteria this explains the absence of plaques for almost all mycobacterium sp tested in this study some plaques were only observed with m bovis bcg which is the sole mycobacterium sp tested with a similar burst time to map 180 min foddai and grant unpublished data however minimal recovery of m bovis bcg 1 was observed when the test was applied after pms confirming the high specificity 99 of the test for map if the optimized phage assay is applied in combination with pms finally no plaques were observed for any of the milk bacteria tested suggesting no risk of interference from bacterial species that might be encountered when testing raw milk for map detection sensitivity specifically lod50 was the last aspect of the pms phage assay investigated in the present study evidence to date suggests that map is typically present in raw milk in low numbers sweeney et al 1992 slana et al 2009 since conventional culture often does not have sufficient sensitivity slana et al 2008a an alternative detection method is required to rapidly demonstrate the presence of viable map in milk and achieve more accurate enumeration results from testing of both artificially and naturally infected milk samples indicate that the optimized pms phage assay possesses the sensitivity needed to detect low levels of map in raw milk the optimized pms phage assay demonstrated higher sensitivity than both pms culture on heym agar plates and pms qpcr targeting either is900 or f57 when the test was used to test whole milk spiked at different levels with two map strains plaques were observed from all the milk samples including those originally spiked with 1 10 map cells per 50 ml higher lod50 were observed for the two other pms based detection methods 100 pfu per 50 ml the higher map detection rates observed with the pms phage assay during raw milk testing further confirmed the higher sensitivity of this test compared to pms culture and pms qpcr viable map cells were detected by pms phage assay in 21 2 of individual milk samples and 59 1 of btm samples tested these detection rates were consistently higher than corresponding rates observed for pms is900 qpcr 9 1 and 45 4 respectively pms f57qpcr 2 6 and 9 1 respectively and pms culture 11 6 and 50 respectively it should be noted that for raw milk testing mgit broth was employed rather than heym agar plates for culture after pms and it was noticeable that the detection sensitivity of pms culture was much improved compared to the outcomes of lod50 determinations using spiked milk from experience liquid culture does tend to be more conducive for map growth than solid culture the optimized pms phage assay proved to be a more sensitive and quicker alternative to conventional culture for demonstrating the presence of viable map in cows milk application of the optimized pms phage assay to test naturally infected milks during this study provided new information on numbers of viable map present in milk from individual animals and btm from johne s affected herds mean map counts estimated from individual infected cows and btm milk were 228 pfu per 50 ml range 6 948 pfu per 50 ml and 144 9 pfu per 50 ml range 18 685 pfu per 50 ml respectively these pms phage assay counts are higher than previous estimates of the numbers of map cells in both individual milk samples 2 8 cfu per 50 ml sweeney et al 1992 100 cfu per ml giese and ahrens 2000 4 20 cfu per 50 ml ayele et al 2005 10 560 cells per ml slana et al 2008b and btm 1 9 cells per ml slana et al 2008b and several tens of cells per ml slana et al 2009 which were obtained by either culture after chemical decontamination or real time qpcr on the basis of the inclusivity specificity and sensitivity of the pms phage assay reported here and its superior performance relative to pms qpcr and pms culture for testing raw milk samples the pms phage assay represents the most sensitive test available to detect viable map in milk however as currently performed the pms phage assay involves two overnight incubations multiple timed steps and additions of reagents and a plaque pcr to confirm map detection hence it is laborious to carry out and it takes 2 3 days to obtain a map positive result only with considerable practice in application of the pms phage assay over several years have consistent results been obtained within our laboratory while the phage amplification assay and pms phage assay are proving to be valuable map research tools the pms phage assay is not suitable for adoption by the dairy industry as a milk screening test in its current format the assay would require some streamlining specifically to eliminate the need for the plaque assay and plaque pcr after phage amplification in order to potentially become such a test potential avenues to achieve this goal are currently being explored in our laboratory to conclude this study has demonstrated that the optimized pms phage assay is 100 inclusive for all map strains tested 99 specific for map and has a lod50 of 1 pfu per 50 ml milk when used in combination with the optimized milk sample preparation protocol foddai and grant 2015 the assay detected viable map in raw milk from a substantial proportion 21 2 of individual cows in a jd affected dairy herd mean map count 228 1 pfu per 50 ml and in 59 1 of btm from jd affected dairy farms in scotland mean map count 136 83 pfu per 50 ml this study has also demonstrated that the optimized pms phage assay is more sensitive than both pms qpcr and pms culture on heym or in mgit liquid medium unfortunately in its present multistep format the pms phage assay does not represent a test that could be easily adopted by the dairy industry for routinely screening large numbers of milk samples to detect the presence of map efforts are continuing to streamline the assay while maintaining its excellent detection sensitivity to make it suitable for that purpose acknowledgementsthe authors thank mr peter orpin the park

The use of social media for medical crowdfunding links people with unmet healthcare needs to charitable donors. There is no doubt that fundraising campaigns using such platforms facilitates access to financial resources to the benefit of patients and their caregivers.\nMAIN TEXT: This paper reports on a critical review of the published literature and information from other online resources discussing medical crowdfunding and the related ethical questions. The review highlighted the benefits of crowdfunding as well as the under-exploration of the risk of having patients' desires and human rights undermined during online fundraising campaigns. Majority of these campaigns get initiated on behalf of the patients, especially the very sick and dependant. The ethical questions raised relate to the voluntariness of informed consent and the possibility of patients being used as a means to an end. Vulnerability of patients may expose them to coercion, undue influence, manipulation, and violation of their human rights. The success of these campaigns is influenced by the digital skills, pre-existing social networks and, the emotional potency. Healthcare is a public good, and online market forces should not determine access to essential health services. The benefits of crowdfunding cannot be subverted, but it can perpetuate unintended injustices, especially those arising from socio-economic factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Policymakers ought to monitor the utilisation of crowdfunding sites to identify policy failures and unmet essential health care needs responsible for driving individuals to use these platforms.

communities exposed to arid conditions in the hot desert of tataouine south tunisia was estimated with a combination of a culture and molecular based analysis thirty one isolates representative of each dominant morphotypes were affiliated to actinobacteria firmicutes proteobacteria and the cfb group while none related to archaea analysis of 16s rrna gene libraries revealed the presence of species related to bacteria and archaea sequences related to archaea were all affiliated to the non thermophilic crenarchaeota subgroup bacterial sequences were dominated by proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria a few sequences were distributed among eight others phyla including thermus deinococcus relatives a correlation between tolerance to desiccation and to radiation has been demonstrated for the radiotolerant bacteria deinococcus radiodurans because bacteria living in the hot desert of tataouine are one way or another tolerant to desiccation we investigate whether they could also be tolerant to radiation exposition of soil samples to intense gamma radiation yields bacillus thermus deinococcus and proteobacteria relatives four of these strains correspond to radiotolerant species as revealed by evaluation of the resistance levels of the individual cultures a detailed analysis of the resistance levels for two thermus deinococcus and two proteobacteria relatives revealed that they correspond to new radiotolerant species citing literaturenumber of times cited according to crossref 130javiera v squez dean felipe maza isidora morel rodrigo pulgar

Starting values for the spectral model greatly influence the final results. Short echo time magnetic resonance spectroscopy contains broad signals that overlap with metabolite signals, complicating the estimation of starting values. We describe a method for more robust initial value estimation using a filter to attenuate short T(2) signal contributions (e.g., macromolecules or residual lipids). The method attenuates signals by truncating early points in the data set. Metabolite peak estimation is simplified by the removal of broad, short T(2) signals, and corrections for metabolite signal truncation are described. Short echo time simulated Monte Carlo data and in vivo data were used to validate the method. Areas for metabolite signals in the Monte Carlo data with singlet (N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline) and singlet-like (myo-inositol) resonances were estimated within 10% of actual value for various metabolite line widths, signal-to-noise ratios, and underlying broad signal contributions. Initial value estimates of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were within 14% of metabolite area ratios relative to the creatine peak fitted using established magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectral analysis software.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

distance from a city in number of miles for example if you choose illinois as the state identifying chicago as the city and 100 miles as the distance will find all studies listing a location within 100 miles of chicago clinical studya research study involving human volunteers also called participants that is intended to add to medical knowledge there are two types of clinical studies interventional studies also called clinical trials and observational studies clinical trialanother name for an interventional study clinicaltrials gov identifier nct number the unique identification

your search by selecting a state and identifying a city and distance cross over assignmenta type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order for example two by two cross over assignment involves two groups of participants one group receives drug a during the initial phase of the trial followed by drug b during a later phase the other group receives drug b during the initial phase followed by drug a so during the trial participants cross over to the other drug all participants receive drug a and drug b at some point during the trial but in a different order depending on the group to which they are assigned data monitoring committee dmc a group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial the dmc can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective is harming participants or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial also called a data safety and monitoring board or dsmb early phase 1 formerly listed as phase 0 a phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body they involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals for example screening studies microdose studies eligibility criteriathe key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria which are required for a person to participate in the study and exclusion criteria which prevent a person from participating types of eligibility criteria include whether a study accepts healthy volunteers has age or age group requirements or is limited by sex enrollmentthe number of participants in a clinical study the estimated enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study exclusion criteriaa type of eligibility criteria these are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study expanded accessa way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the u s food and drug administration fda also called compassionate use there are different expanded access types for more information see fda expanded access information for patients expanded access statusavailable expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be

be available in the future temporarily not available expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future approved for marketing the intervention has been approved by the u s food and drug administration for use by the public expanded access typedescribes the category of expanded access under u s food and drug administration fda regulations there are three types of expanded access individual patients allows a single patient with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this category also includes access in an emergency situation intermediate size population allows more than one patient but generally fewer patients than through a treatment ind protocol access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda treatment ind protocol allows a large widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use experimental arman arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial extension requestin certain circumstances a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline generally one year after the primary completion date the request for an extension must demonstrate good cause

trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions for example two by two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions 1 drug a and drug b 2 drug a and a placebo 3 a placebo and drug b or 4 a placebo and a placebo so during the trial all possible combinations of the two drugs a and b and the placebos are given to different groups of participants fdaaa 801 violationsa fdaaa 801 violation is shown on a study record when the u s food and drug administration fda has issued a notice of noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial a notice of noncompliance indicates that the fda has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 section 801 fdaaa 801 the national library of medicine nlm is required by fdaaa 801 to add information to a study record about any fdaaa 801 violation this information is provided by the fda there are three categories of information that may be included violation shown when the fda issues a notice of noncompliance and posts the notice of noncompliance on its designated webpage there are three types of violations failure to submit required clinical trial informationsubmission of false or misleading clinical trial informationfailure to submit primary and secondary outcomescorrection shown when the fda confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage because of the time for fda review and processing there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the fdaaa 801 violation information penalty shown when the fda imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty

not know which participants have been assigned which interventions types of masking include open label single blind masking and double blind masking nct numbera unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on clinicaltrials gov the format is nct followed by an 8 digit number for example nct00000419 also called the clinicaltrials gov identifier no intervention arman arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention treatment during the clinical trial observational studya type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes participants may receive diagnostic therapeutic or other types of interventions but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions treatment a patient registry is a type of observational study observational study modelthe general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study types of observational study models include cohort case control case only case cross over ecologic or community studies family based and other other adverse eventan adverse event that is not a serious adverse event meaning that it does not result in death is not life threatening does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect it also does not put the participant in danger and does not require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above other study idsidentifiers or id numbers other than the nct number that are assigned to a clinical study by the study s sponsor funders or others these numbers may include unique identifiers from other trial registries and national institutes of health grant numbers other termsin the search feature the other terms field is used to narrow a search for example you may enter the name of a drug or the nct number of a clinical study to limit the search to study records that contain these words outcome measurefor clinical trials a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention treatment on participants for observational studies a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits or associations with exposures risk factors or treatment types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure parallel assignmenta type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions for example a two arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants one group receives drug a and the other group receives drug b so during the trial participants in one group receive drug a in parallel to participants in the other group who receive drug b participant flowa summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study by study arm or group cohort this includes the number of participants who started completed and dropped out of the study patient registrya type of observational study that collects information about patients medical conditions and or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world phasethe stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product based on definitions developed by the u s food and drug administration fda the phase is based on the study s objective the number of participants and other characteristics there are five phases early phase 1 formerly listed as phase 0 phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and phase 4 not applicable is used to describe trials without fda defined phases including trials of devices or behavioral interventions phase 1a phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug they are usually conducted with healthy volunteers and the goal is to determine the drug s most frequent and serious adverse events and often how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body these trials usually involve a small number of participants phase 2a phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition disease that is the drug s effectiveness for example participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment usually an inactive substance called a placebo or a different drug safety continues to be evaluated and short term adverse events are studied phase 3a phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug s safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs these studies typically involve more participants phase 4a phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after fda has approved a drug for marketing they include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor these trials gather additional information about a drug s safety efficacy or optimal use phase not applicabledescribes trials without fda defined phases including trials of devices or behavioral interventions placeboan inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as and is given in the same way as an active drug or intervention treatment being studied placebo comparator arman arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial primary completion datethe date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date for clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures the estimated primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study primary

not mean that the national institutes of health nih has determined that the request demonstrates good cause the process for review and granting of extension requests by the nih is being developed city and distancein the search feature the city field is used to find clinical studies with locations in a specific city the distance field is used to find studies with locations within the specified distance from a city in number of miles for example if you choose illinois as the state identifying chicago as the city and 100 miles as the distance will find all studies listing a location within 100 miles of chicago clinical studya research study involving human volunteers also called participants that is intended to add to medical knowledge there are two types of clinical studies interventional studies also called clinical trials and observational studies clinical trialanother name for an interventional study clinicaltrials gov identifier nct number the unique identification code given to each clinical study upon registration at clinicaltrials gov the format is nct followed by an 8 digit number for example nct00000419 collaboratoran organization other than the sponsor

illness or injury that is being studied on clinicaltrials gov conditions may also include other health related issues such as lifespan quality of life and health risks contactthe name and contact information for the person who can answer enrollment questions for a clinical study each location where the study is being conducted may also have a specific contact who may be better able to answer those questions countryin the search feature the country field is used to find clinical studies with locations in a specific country for example if you choose the united states you can then narrow your search by selecting a state and identifying a city and distance cross over assignmenta type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order for example two by two cross over assignment involves two groups of participants one group receives drug a during the initial phase of the trial followed by drug b during a later phase the other group receives drug b during the initial phase followed by drug a so during the trial participants cross over to the other drug all participants receive drug a and drug b at some point during the trial but in a different order depending on the group to which they are assigned data monitoring committee dmc a group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial the dmc can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective is harming participants or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial also called a data safety and monitoring board or dsmb early phase 1 formerly listed as phase 0 a phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body they involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals for example screening studies microdose studies eligibility criteriathe key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria which are required for a person to participate in the study and exclusion criteria which prevent a person from participating types of eligibility criteria include whether a study accepts healthy volunteers has age or age group requirements or is limited by sex enrollmentthe number of participants in a clinical study the estimated enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study exclusion criteriaa type of eligibility criteria these are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study expanded accessa way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the u s food and drug administration fda also called compassionate use there are different expanded access types for more information see fda expanded access information for patients expanded access statusavailable expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug biologic or medical device being studied no longer available expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future temporarily not available expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future approved for marketing the intervention has been approved by the u s food and drug administration for use by the public expanded access typedescribes the category of expanded access under u s food and drug administration fda regulations there are three types of expanded access individual patients allows a single patient with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this category also includes access in an emergency situation intermediate size population allows more than one patient but generally fewer patients than through a treatment ind protocol access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda treatment ind protocol allows a large widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the fda this type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use experimental arman arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial extension requestin certain circumstances a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline generally one year after the primary completion date the request for an extension must demonstrate good cause for example the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial all requests must be reviewed and granted by the national institutes of health this process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed see delay results type in the results data element definitions for more information factorial assignmenta type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions for example two by two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions 1 drug a and drug b 2 drug a and a placebo 3 a placebo and drug b or 4 a placebo and a placebo so during the trial all possible combinations of the two drugs a and b and the placebos are given to different groups of participants fdaaa 801 violationsa fdaaa 801 violation is shown on a study record when the u s food and drug administration fda has issued a notice of noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial a notice of noncompliance indicates that the fda has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 section 801 fdaaa 801 the national library of medicine nlm is required by fdaaa 801 to add information to a study record about any fdaaa 801 violation this information is provided by the fda there are three categories of information that may be included violation shown when the fda issues a notice of noncompliance and posts the notice of noncompliance on its designated webpage there are three types of violations failure to submit required clinical trial informationsubmission of false or misleading clinical trial informationfailure to submit primary and secondary outcomescorrection shown when the fda confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage because of the time for fda review and processing there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the fdaaa 801 violation information penalty shown when the fda imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage first postedthe date on which the study record was first available on clinicaltrials gov there is typically a delay of a few days between the date the study sponsor or

all study records include this level of detail about locations maskinga clinical trial design strategy in which one or more parties involved in the trial such as the investigator or participants do not know which participants have been assigned which interventions types of masking include open label single blind masking and double blind masking nct numbera unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on clinicaltrials gov the format is nct followed by an 8 digit number for example nct00000419 also called the clinicaltrials gov identifier no intervention arman arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention treatment during the clinical trial observational studya type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes participants may receive diagnostic therapeutic or other types of interventions but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions treatment a patient registry is a type of observational study observational study modelthe general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study types of observational study models include cohort case control case only case cross over ecologic or community studies family based and other other adverse eventan adverse event that is not a serious adverse event meaning that it does not result in death is not life threatening does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect it also does not put the

contain these words outcome measurefor clinical trials a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention treatment on participants for observational studies a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits or associations with exposures risk factors or treatment types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure parallel assignmenta type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions for example a two arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants one group receives drug a and the other group receives drug b so during the trial participants in one group receive drug a in parallel to participants in the other group who receive drug b participant flowa summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study by study arm or group cohort this includes the number of participants who started completed and dropped out of the study patient registrya type of observational study that collects information about patients medical conditions and or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world phasethe stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product based on definitions developed by the u s food and drug administration fda the phase is based on the study s objective the number of participants and other characteristics there are five phases early phase 1 formerly listed as phase 0 phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and phase 4 not applicable is used to describe trials without fda defined phases including trials of devices or behavioral interventions phase 1a phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug they are usually conducted with healthy volunteers and the goal is to determine the drug s most frequent and serious adverse events and often how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body these trials usually involve a small number of participants phase 2a phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition disease that is the drug s effectiveness for example participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment usually an inactive substance called a placebo or a different drug safety continues to be evaluated and short term adverse events are studied phase 3a phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug s safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs these studies typically involve more participants phase 4a phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after fda has approved a drug for marketing they include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor these trials gather additional information about a drug s safety efficacy or optimal use phase not applicabledescribes trials without fda defined phases including trials of devices or behavioral interventions placeboan inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as and is given in the same way as an active drug or intervention treatment being studied placebo comparator arman arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial primary completion datethe date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date for clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures the estimated primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study primary outcome measurein a clinical study s protocol the planned outcome measure that is the most important for evaluating the effect of an intervention treatment most clinical studies have one primary outcome measure but some have more than one primary purposethe main reason for the clinical trial the types of primary purpose are treatment prevention diagnostic supportive care screening health

condition or disease intervention treatment phase diabetic neuropathy peripheraldevice high tone power therapyother selected physical therapy programnot applicable show detailed description hide detailed descriptiondetailed description diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose or blood sugar which leads over time to serious damage to the heart blood vessels eyes kidneys and nerves the most common is type 2 diabetes usually in adults which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn t make enough insulin diabetic neuropathies dns are nerve damaging disorders associated with diabetes mellitus these conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves vasa nervorum in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy the most common characteristics of diabetic neuropathy dn are a distal symmetrical primarily sensory polyneuropathy affecting the feet and legs in a chronic slowly progressive manner the incidence and prevalence of dn associated with duration of diabetes affect up to 50 of diabetic patients although dn is known as the most common complications of diabetes diabetic neuropathy is estimated that 40 to 50 of people with diabetes will have dn within 10 years of diagnosis high tone power therapy hi top is the percutaneous electrical stimulation of skeletal muscles using alternative frequencies between 4 096 and 32 768 hertz to produce a muscle contraction and the treatment of diabetic neuropathy the therapy frequency is scanned with a defined frequency this method is called simulfam for simultaneous frequency amplitude modulation high tone power therapy hi top is a new quantum leap in the field of electro therapy it is electrotherapy with sinusoidal alternating currents the high tone power therapy provides a therapy with medium frequency sine waves the therapy is free of direct current d c components the amplitude and the frequency are modulated simultaneously the higher the frequency the more energy can be introduced corresponding to the individual threshold curve of the patient s electrosensitivity a short term intervention over 5 days with hitop has the potential to immediately reduce pain with a significantly stronger analgesic effect than tens particularly the first period of intervention showed that htems reduces pain to a greater extent than tens from a clinical point of view htems showed a promising result especially when comparing with tens or considering the short period of intervention time significance of the study diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes it affects the feet and legs first followed by the hands and arms signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night and include numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes tingling or burning sensation sharp pain or cramps muscle weakness loss of reflexes especially in the ankle and loss of balance and coordination sensory nerve action potential amplitude and conduction velocity cv have been shown to be sensitive indicators of nerve degeneration in patients with diabetes and have been used to detect dn diabetic neuropathy is associated with low sensory nerve amplitude potential snap and cv recently shown in a pilot study that high tone power therapy stimulation of the thigh causing isometric muscle contraction might be an effective treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy high tone power therapy can stimulate a large number of nerves in the thigh might therefore lead to a spinal stimulation that in turn decreases excitability of small nerve fibers and lead to improve function of diabetic neuropathy so the current

Metastasis is the main factor leading to cancer progression and poor prognosis, and at the beginning of metastasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial activation. However, the relationship between PMEPA1 and EMT in colorectal cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. In this study, we first testified that PMEPA1 expresses higher in tumour than normal tissue in Gene Expression Omnibus database, in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as in the clinical data we collected. Moreover, the higher expression was associated with poor prognosis. We furthermore demonstrated PMEPA1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis and EMT in vivo and in vitro. We found that PMEPA1 activates the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signalling of TGF-β signalling resulting in promoting EMT and accelerating the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer.", "abstract_source": "pubmed"}

there had recently been brought a sick parrot a clinical picture characteristic either of influenzal pneumonia or of typhoid was present in all the patients a report of this house epidemic is deemed worthy of record at this time because of the unusual interest and publicity attached to the cases of psittacosis recently described in various parts of this country and europe by the lay press and because in this instance a careful clinical bacteriologic and epidemiologic study was made this comprehensive investigation was made possible through the cooperation of the laboratory of the new york

materialabstracteuropean hazelnut corylus avellana l is a strictly cross pollinated diploid tree species which has its northernmost populations in fennoscandia and it was one of the first species to recolonize northern europe after the last ice age hazelnut produces edible nuts in finland but nowadays they are underutilized as food and currently no breeding programmes exist in the present study 300 hazelnut specimens were collected from 20 different locations populations in finland and they were genetically analyzed using nine simple sequence repeat ssr markers most of the genetic diversity existed within populations 83 according to different genetic analyses structure principal coordinates analysis and clustering a general lack of structure was observed suggesting extensive gene flow among hazelnuts between 17 investigated populations however genetic structuring was clearly observed in three populations hakavuori mustiala and p hkin m ki which might have become isolated due to geographical barriers that kept them separate diminishing gene flow from other populations studying the diversity of european hazelnut is of great interest for understanding population genetics of a species distributed in its marginal areas in the north and the results are also valuable for further uses in plant conservation selection and possible future breeding actions in finland r sum le
