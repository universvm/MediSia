# TTDS Group Project

## Git Rules

1. Open an issue for each change that needs to be done. 
2. Work on a branch and commit changes starting with issue number eg. "#19 Add search module"
3. Always review code before merging into master

If you want to follow stricter Git rules for a better repository, read here: https://github.com/universvm/git-guidelines

## Project Structure

Each module should be in a separate folder to avoid conflicts at merge. 

A general folder structure could look like this:

- ui/
- index/
- backend/
- text_processing/

##Â Python Style

Exclusively PEP8 (ie. 4 spaces not 2). You can format your code with BLACK (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
